But after 30 minutes of waiting in line and watching the servers completely fumbling over each other - they were clearly inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing, I knew we were doomed.  But we had already waited that long so we stayed.  From the line, I watched table after table trying to flag someone down because they wanted to pay.  No one would come to them.  I look over to see where the servers are and all four servers, standing together near the cash register looking completely flustered.  Meanwhile, there is a gigantic line outside, which is continuing to grow, and tables are empty and cleared and no one is coming to address the customers waiting in line.  Finally, after about 40 minutes, the man in front of me started to get annoyed obviously by seeing pretty much half the restaurant clear out and no one being seated so he walks in to the four servers standing around the cash register and says something to them.  Finally, one server comes and takes that man and his friend and seats them at the counter.  Then she goes back to standing there - like deer in headlights.  Good grief. Then it was my turn to flag the girl down and tell her that I am happy to sit at the counter as there are empty chairs.  When I tell her that, then she seats us, finally.   I have no idea how long the others continued to wait outside. \\\\n\\\\nOnce at the counter, we ordered, two noodle soup dishes.  it was pretty uneventful and unflavorful.  Maybe it was what I ordered, or maybe it was because they were so busy that they were rushing and not preparing food properly.  \\\\n\\\\nWe ate here because we watched Rock of Ages at the Venetian.

When it did arrive, only the sandwiches were hot.  The soup was both lukewarm and bland; as if they were attempting to pay homage to grilled cheese with condensed Campbell\\'s soup from childhood.  My fries were also not hot, though we did have both items promptly replaced with a hotter version.\\\\n\\\\nThe final issue that left us sour was that with the second round of flights, they were out of the normal glassware to do them.  The bartender\\'s solution was to use shot glasses, netting us a serving that was half size.  This was called out, and we did get an extra pint, but I am not sure why free glassware from Sam Adams is in such short supply in a beer based gastropub, especially when the flight glasses are free from a Sam Adams rep.\\\\n\\\\nThe entire experience reaffirmed that the only way to do The Yard is drinks only, and only at the bar rail.

Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail.

I must give credit where credit is due; the SIDE ITEMS were great.  But it ended there.  Neither the chicken nor the shrimp had any flavor to them whatsoever.  I was shocked.  I didn\\'t even finish my chicken tenders because they didn\\'t seem fully cooked to me.  The breading on them was very light in color, very flaky, and TASTELESS, as though it was nothing more than mere flour and maybe egg whites or buttermilk?  No seasoning at all.  Same with the shrimp.  Very blah to say the least.  And very disappointing.  \\\\n\\\\nService I must admit was much better than expected, although bordering on smothering.  Had a very young waiter that seemed to try way too hard to \\\\\"be there\\\\\" for us and to try to be pleasant & friendly (was somewhat forced rather than genuine).  Started to get on my nerves (then again if you knew me, you\\'d know that when you begin getting smothery you\\'re pushing my buttons big-time!).  However given the negative reviews I\\'d heard in the past regarding service, I\\'d rather have this than a non-existent server, so I quickly got over that.  He also didn\\'t seem to be that familiar with the menu & its flexibility (ie: this can be subbed for that, etc), so that was a little bit of a turnoff to my dining companion.\\\\n\\\\nIn a nutshell University City has far too many dining options, so I wouldn\\'t select Cheddar\\'s again.  Even with commendable service, the food has to match, and this place just didn\\'t work for me, not even a little.  I\\'d rather eat at Chick-Fil-A across the street!'},\n",

I found the sofa that I wanted/needed and closed the deal. The 1 star is for the poor customer service. The sofa was supposed to be delivered on a Wed afternoon on and Wed morning I received a call telling me part of the sofa was damaged and they would only be delivering part of my order. The other part would be coming a week later. \\\\n\\\\nI had an event scheduled for the weekend and now would have limited seating. I asked if there would be any kind of concession (they should have offered a concession instead of me having to ask for one)  and was offered a $75.00 gift card to Ashley...um, no. I then was referred to a Customer Service person who offered to refund me the delivery charges. I gave her my cc # and she said she would take care of it. 3 days later no refund, nor a peep from anyone at Ashley Furniture. Today after making multiple calls I find that it will now take 2-7 business days to process my refund, a very important tidbit of info the CSR neglected to tell me. I also needed to confirm the delivery date for my remaining item, but since the CSR only sent me a message through another rep and didn't call me herself, I wasn't able to confirm the delivery and had to call back yet a 3rd time. \\\\n\\\\nI work in sales and deal with customers every day. Though the sales experience was good, the follow up and lack of customer service negates the great service I received on the front end of the transaction. If a refund is due, the customer should be given a time line right then in which to expect the transaction completed and not have to hunt down the CSR for answers...3 days later. I won't be ordering anything else from Ashley Furniture again and though I'd like to put the rep on blast, I will refrain from doing so as that doesn't fix the situation. \\\\n\\\\nFinal thoughts...it's equally important to pay attention to your customers AFTER the sale as it is during the sale. People have choices and can spend their money elsewhere and word of mouth is powerful.\"},\n",

The service was even worse than before and seemed far more chaotic than usual. We sat outside. Waited over 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order. It got worse from there...appetizer was dropped off by a random server and left without providing plates, napkins, utensils. We waited a few minutes then ended up stealing some from other tables. Our server brought our wings out along with a tray full of food for another table. She struggles to get outside with the tray, dropped off our wings and struggled to get back inside with the full tray. She had no plates, no utensils, no dressing or celery. So we sat...and sat...and sat. When we finally got everything we needed to eat, the wings were no longer hot. As all of this was going on, it was obvious that it wasn\\'t the servers who were at fault. It was lack of organization and direction. We asked to see the manager.\\\\n\\\\nThe owner/manager comes out and we explained the whole scenario and how frustrated we were.

Essentially, your options for this are very limited!\\\\n\\\\nThis was such an abuse of power and such idiocy. They greeted us with... Intimidation and anger! (Bizarre to say the least) On this day, parking opened ONE HOUR BEFORE THE EVENT??? A few hours ago the \\\\\"day of website\\\\\" said 3pm so we planned accordingly... Ready to tailgate before the Oddball (Comedy) Festival, we checked it again at noon, still said 3pm. There should be a way to subscribe for updates... \\\\n\\\\nWe planned and checked the \\\\\"day of\\\\\" link, arrive only to find it had again been updated and get aggressive personnel tell us to turn around, and leave right away. What? Event is at 5, now parking doesn\\'t open till 4pm? The officer, frankly, was a jerk too! (Ok, the time changed, but handle it better!!!)\\\\n\\\\nWe had just pulled in, we\\'re asking the parking lot attendant when it changed and up comes a macho police officer (so he thought he was), stomping up to our car to interject. What was odd, is he came out of nowhere, we had been there for about 35 seconds, seated and buckled talking through our window, and up comes this officer with Napoleon Complex - or some issue...  He quickly waddles up - like he\\'s chaeffed or something - and before my husband (driver) can turn his head to look at him he yells, \\\\\"TURN AROUND!\\\\\" Then walks up to his window and yells it again. Annoyed, but knowing not to do anything stupid, my husband says \\\\\"Yes, sir\\\\\" and still, this officer is yelling, turn around. I have to imagine he had JUST come off of a case or some issue - nothing could explain his approach, aggressiveness and anger. Becuase you never know how crazy people are or when they will chose to abuse their power, we did as asked and left - and then SAT IN A PARKING LOT A MILE AWAY FOR AN HOUR! Stupid! If we had the time, I would have gotten this guy\\'s name and badge number to file a formal complaint. Since I didn\\'t/couldn\\'t, I\\'m venting here. \\\\n\\\\nTIP FOR \\\\\"SECURITY\\\\\": How about, I don\\'t know, you speak in a normal tone and explain the schedule changed. It was interesting watching the the attendant\\'s emotions go from angry and annoyed, while sitting, to STANDING (remind you, we\\'re seated in our car), with a red face and teetering angrily like he\\'s going to fight or have an accident in his pants...? This is so bizarre, and frankly pitiful. Especially since we paid a lot of money for VIP parking and box seats. \\\\n\\\\nReconsider the next time you attend an event here, my husband swears he won\\'t return.  PNC/LiveNation, revisit your parking policy, your hours, your communication of last minute changes, and add some bathrooms throughout the parking lot. \\\\n\\\\nHad to share our experience. From reading other reviews, their whole parking situation, unprofessional parking staff\\'s and police\\'s manner of handling parking, the admission process and exit procedures have cost them some well earned negative reviews and a poor reputation. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, I\\'ve noticed they don\\'t adhere to the \\\\\"no tall camping chairs\\\\\" in the lawn rule. So if you go, be prepared to be treat poorly, wait forever to park, if you\\'re in the lawn just know you cannot see over the tall chairs, and know it takes a good 1+ hour to exit while nearly getting hit by aggressive drivers trying to cut in front of you (or drunkenly into the side of you)... oh, and don\\'t bother paying extra for VIP parking (there\\'s nothing VIP about it). VIP seats are fine, but don\\'t pay for the parking \\\\\"upgrade.\\\\\" Tsk tsk PNC!\\\\n\\\\nThe learnings for PNC/LiveNation: Provide updates on changing parking lot times, allow MORE time so families CAN tailgate (you\\'re not using the lot anyway, let guests in and get settled), provide restrooms/porta-potties in the lots, make parking & LEAVING much safer and more efficient. Lastly, teach your staff and the hired help some manners. As for the performers - they always provide a great experience! As I hope would be expected, this is a review on the services and the venue itself only. Don\\'t bother doing lawn seats unless you don\\'t mind having some big guy in a large camping chair sitting in front of you either... if you can, pay extra for seats.'},\n",

I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn\\'t give stipulations anywhere and that\\'s false advertising (not even sure if that\\'s legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn\\'t good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I\\'m pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it\\'s very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!'},\n",

We all enjoyed the decor, the service was so so, but the food was absolutely disgusting. We started things off with 2 waters and a diet coke and ordered the \\\\\"Awesome Appetizer\\\\\". All the food on the platter (2 chix strips, 2 chimmi cha cha\\'s ,crab dip, and calamari) was cold except the crab dip which was piping hot. One thing I don\\'t understand is the chix strips and calamari where both very lightly cooked almost underdone but the chimi cha cha (similar to a chili\\'s southwestern eggroll) was overcooked and really dark. Having worked in a restaurant for a few years I knew this was from using old fry oil that had gone too long without filtration or replacement, it causes a burnt crust with an almost smoky/bitter taste and an undercooked center.\\\\n\\\\nFor our main dishes I had ordered a cobb salad and my wife had the \\\\\"Rasta Pasta\\\\\". My salad was also pretty bad, a good portion of the lettuce was wilted. It was also pretty clear that they didn\\'t take the time to dry the lettuce after washing it. The wet lettuce couldn\\'t hold onto the dressing which caused a pool of water/dressing to form in the bottom of my bowl. My wifes pasta wasn\\'t as disgusting, but it wasn\\'t good either. The chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland.\\\\n\\\\nThe total bill for our meal came to just over $70 which is way to much for the quality of the food. After 11 nights in Las Vegas this is by far the worst place we ate at, I have no idea why the MGM Grand would allow the restaurant in it\\'s casino.

I should start off by saying that I am not a fan of McGrath - personality wise but, I did (once upon a time) like his food.  Also since I live in far N.S its nice to have options in the area.  We decided to give this place a try last night and what a huge disappointment.\\\\n\\\\nWe arrived early for our reservations and were seated directly, the bus boy was very quick with the water - good.\\\\n\\\\nWaitress was m.i.a for what seemed sometime - maybe she wasn't told that she had a table.  But, once she appeared all was good.\\\\n\\\\nFood...not so good.  The signature pork chile seemed bland (not what I remember it to be) but, good enough.  2 entr\\\\u00e9es, the pork rack and the short ribs.\\\\n\\\\nThe short ribs are absolutely drenched in a Dr. Pepper sauce.  They were moist but, I couldn't taste much beyond that sauce even when I managed to wipe it off the meat.  Overwhelming!  The chile risotto, not cooked properly.  Not al dente simply not cooked.  Also room temperature and absolutely no flavor, despite the fact that I added salt and pepper still no flavor.  The dish did come with a little frisee salad with I believe marinated red onions, this was nice - wish I had more of that on my plate!\\\\n\\\\nThe pork rack better than the short ribs but, again no flavor.  The restaurants signature and concept is based around the Wood-Fired Rotisserie, one would think this would impart a ton of aroma and  flavor but, no, nothing.  Again BBB and Dull!  The grits might as well have been cooked in nothing but water.\\\\n\\\\nSide - Super Greens, Kale, Bacon, Red Onion, Cider Vinegar - OK there is nothing I love more than kale in any variety and any preparation, I simply love it but, this was the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life.  The kale was tough and had an extremely gamy taste... I couldn't stomach more than two bites then had to send it back.  \\\\n\\\\nSomeone did come out to inquire about the kale and offered us another side dish which we declined.  \\\\n\\\\nThe service turned out to be very good and we were also offered complimentary desserts which we also declined - at that point we were no longer interested in seeing more from the kitchen.  \\\\n\\\\nI'm not sure whats going on in the kitchen but, clearly flavor is not on the agenda - is anyone tasting this food?

I would imagine that if Canada was ever stricken with war or famine or some sort of severe economic inflation, we would have to pay $15-30 for each 3 bites of food like we did at Toro Toro. \\\\n\\\\nNow on to the food itself: they take pieces of McCain potatoes, broil in the oven, cover them with a creamy garlic sauce, and give it a fancy Spanish name - if that impresses you, great...I wasn\\'t so impressed. \\\\n\\\\nThe octopus plate was ok, but there was barely enough in the plate to actually enjoy it - more of a teaser. \\\\n\\\\nBy far, the biggest disappointment was the paella. The rice was doughy and clumpy, and each plate of \\\\\"seafood paella\\\\\" comes with 2 small pieces of shrimp. Again, it had the feel of cheapness and poverty. \\\\n\\\\n3 of the tapas in their menu were not even available - but in retrospect, that was probably a good thing as it avoided what I\\'m sure would have been 3 more disappointments. \\\\n\\\\nEven their bread is served in tiny, heartbreaking portions. They only had 2 choices of desert. Any place that doesn\\'t several churros shouldn\\'t be allowed to call itself a Spanish tapas restaurant!!\\\\n\\\\nWe ended up tripling our original order of tapas and still all left hungry. \\\\n\\\\nAside from that, the music was annoyingly loud and their table layout was unpleasant - they use picnic style tables meant for 8 or 10 people each, so you might get seated elbow-to-elbow with strangers. \\\\n\\\\nNeedless to say, our whole group unanimously agreed that this was a terrible experience, and we won\\'t be going back.'},\n",

Anyway, I thought I was going to be able to show him this really awesome place with great food because of all the great reviews.  \\\\n\\\\nLet me ask you...do you people have dead tastebuds???\\\\n\\\\nWe shared the Fire Fries...those I will give some props to...they were good and left my lips on fire!  But they seem like something you can easily make at home.\\\\n\\\\nWe both got smoothies.  I got the Creamy Strawberry one and my friend got the Strawberry Banana one.  They are non fat.  My male man did ask if they had a fat option, they don't.  They were pretty tasteless.  They tasted fresh I will give them that, but there wasn't enough fruit to really give it a kick that it needed.  My smoothie was made with non fat sweet cream and it just tasted like milk with one strawberry grinded in there for color.\\\\n\\\\nNext we both got macaroni and cheese.  It was so bland.  I decided not to eat it because it wasn't worth the calorie in take.  We tried to put some pepper in it, we tried some salt.  Nothing could save it.  We both agreed on this, so it's not like one of us thought it was wonderful and the other was having a grumpy tummy day.  The table next to us didn't care so much for their food either.\\\\n\\\\nOn and upside, our server was pretty good...and he refused to sell some lady who came in all of the remaining bags of chocolate chip cookies.  So thank you nameless server guy for that.\\\\n\\\\nLet's talk turkey...I mean dessert (this place is Vegan/Vegetarian for the most part, so there isn't a whole lot of turkey...but they do have it and I wish I had gotten the grilled chicken and turkey panini.) Anyway, the chocolate chip cookies are Vegan.  VEGAN!!!  And delicious.  I mean they were probably the best cc cookies I have ever had.  Pretty much everyone has to leave with a bag of them and now I know why. \\\\n\\\\nI also had the famous red velvet cupcake.  The reviews on this are spot on...OMG, party in my mouth.

Its not the real line, its just the line to pay and then go stand in line, wait time at lunch about 40 minutes, play on your smartphone.\\\\nNow the food. Their niche apparently is to serve most everthing in cute little one portion varying vesself from porcelain cups, plastic cups, little metal pots, skewers etc. But they give you at best a 8inch square plate to put these 5 inche round cupped servings = you can only get about three of these tapas sized portions on the plate and are forced to put not cupped item around the cups and touching the sides. The whole thing weighs about 4 lbs on your way back to the table and contains about 8 ounces of food. The shrimp items were delicious and actually tasted like shrimp and you did not have to peel the shells. Very few vegetables. I repeat very few. All of the fish was set out in this portion concept and I nearly choked from their dryness and overcooked status. Pizza right out of the wood fired oven is great, but when it sits out one lonlely slice under heat lamps you get it, dried out. The good. Salads were excellent and unusual, great little shrimp cocktails, mashed potatoes, sake turkey roast, hand carved country bacon, sushi very plain but decent, lots of food turnover on popular items, but the not so popular items sit, and sit.\\\\nDesert area is very unique with some real memorable items like giant white and dark covered strawberries that would go for about $3 each outside of the buffet. Good cookies, but seriously are you going to this buffet for cookies? I did not try the dim sum, or any of the breads. The stinger is the buffet cost about $24 including one alcoholic beverage that you cannot opt out of. While the concept is unique and you will probably not see another display of foods in this format, your appreciation of quality fine food will not permit you to return. In summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other Vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time. Too many trips of heavy plates full of tiny portions for $24 and I didnt want the Bloody Mary. Since a Bloody Mary the same size in one of their bars cost $12 the buffet would be worth $12.\\\\nParis, is superior food for about 30% less money.'},\n",

I felt, since my picky brother enjoyed his strange meal that I should at least give it 2 stars. If we are to base it solely on my dish and that of my friends- a one star would more than suffice. That being said, I have to wonder if I should have eaten something other than crepes. I see my fellow trusted yelpers enjoyed their meals- but none of them eat the crepes!\\\\n\\\\nEven if I never had a crepe before, let alone the AMAZING light as a cloud crepes from Paris 66 I would still know the crepes served here are largely inedible. But I am getting ahead of myself.\\\\n\\\\nThe place was largely empty when we arrived on a late weekend morning. Only about 3 other tables besides our party of 4. Yet we waited for over an hour for 2 orders of crepes, french toast, and a sandwich. Really? \\\\n\\\\nOur waitress was not much for conversation. My friend, who is notoriously more picky than my brother requested whipped cream instead of something else in her crepe. At first, the waitress tried to convince her not to change the menu as it would annoy the cooks. After a few minutes of talking she finally accepted my friends request. She wanted to add whipped cream not lobster I don't see what the fuss was about to begin with- bygones.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered a fruit crepe. Which the exception of the cooking outcome resembling a burnt-ish flaming campfire marshmallow, folded up like an egg roll, the taste was boring, burnt, and listless. I eat two bites and put down my napkin. I had no idea one could defile a crepe in such a way until that day. \\\\n\\\\nMy friend that requested the whipped cream. If I thought my crepe saw a rough afternoon her looked like it was literally dropped on the floor a few times then thrown on the plate. Guess they showed her for ordering that whipped cream? I can see now why the waitress warned us not to change the menu. May I suggest that their employees partake in some local anger management meetings?\\\\n\\\\nMy brother ordered the savory french toast. Italian made with ham, capicola, salami, pepperoni, and marinara Sauce. He loved it. Then again he also loves McD's and Taco Bell. I did not try his meal, I took his word for it.\\\\n\\\\nMy husband ordered a sandwich The Club- he said it was good. Not bad, not great but good. \\\\n\\\\nLastly, I was not a fan of their coffee either. I could not wait to leave. I only live a few blocks away and needed to go home to make something to eat.\\\\n\\\\nOn a positive note, I loved the Einstein artwork.

We put our order in about 40 minutes before arriving at the restaurant. My fella called in and had the store on speaker while he ordered so I heard both sides of the conversation. He ordered the chicken and told them we would be by in about 30-40 minutes to pick up our order and that we had a Groupon to redeem.

The guy then referred us to the girl behind the counter who I assume is the one who took our phone order. She explained that they have had problems with people ordering over the phone in the past with a Groupon and showing up and not actually having a Groupon to redeem that they refuse to start cooking orders for customers with Groupons until customers show up. I can understand this as a problem, but I don\\'t really understand why she couldn\\'t have explained any of this to us over the phone when we put our order in. There were several other customers who had this precise problem that walked in after us and they were quite peeved as well.

By this time, my fella was quite thirsty and asked for something to drink. They offered us a free two liter for our trouble and to be fair the staff was quite friendly to all that were waiting for their chicken, giving us updates as to how much longer we would have to wait and offering us beverages while we stood around. They could avoid all hostility with customers if they just explained their stance on phone orders in advance instead of having people come all the way in only to find out they have to order again in person and wait.\\\\n\\\\nThe food was really good, probably 4 stars if I was rating the food alone.

Over the phone, he was very helpful and said that I should come downstairs to check their chargers to see if any one of them worked.  I don't mean to sound like a princess, but I honestly did NOT want to walk my lazy ass downstairs.  I had  been working all day setting up our booth for a trade show and just wanted someone to come up and show me the chargers so I can pick the one that fits and put my feet up and RELAX.  So I walk my lazy butt downstairs to the concierge and find her helping another guest.  I wait for 5 minutes and can't wait longer so walk over to the front desk and they of course tell me to go back to the concierge.  I'm back in line behind the same couple asking all sorts of questions about some show seating.  I wait another 5 minutes and the concierge looks over to me says that she will be awhile and asks me what I needed in a slight annoyed and definitely hurried fashion.  I tell her another concierge told me to come down to pick up a charger.  She then literally dumps a bunch of chargers my way and tells me to choose one.  By this time I'm feeling like I interrupted Mommy and Daddy at a really busy time.  WTF!!!  Anyways, none of the chargers fit so I walked my ass to the business center as a just in case and surely they had one that fit.  Initially they told me to leave my phone there while it was being charged, but I asked if I could take the charger up to my room, since I needed my phone for business.  They said no problem and I gave them my room number and happily left that I didn't have to pay for a brand new one.\\\\nWhen I got back to my room later that evening, I had a message from the business center saying that if I wanted to keep the charger for the duration of my stay, they would charge me $5 a day.  I still don't know how I really feel about that.  I screwed up and forgot my charger, but I just don't feel good about it.\\\\n\\\\nThe rooms are nice.  It seems impressive, but again it's an illusion.  For example, the sunken in oval bath tub is nice.  Visually it looks porcelain, but it's plastic.  The LIGHTS!!!  WTF is up with the lights.  The switch turned on the ALL the lights, but you couldn't turn on the side lamps  by the couches unless the main lights were on.  It was weird.  They do have a kitchen and I guess it would be useful if you were cooking, but didn't need any utensils or plates or even kitchenware to cook your food in.  This is HIGH CLASS CAVE MAN LIVING!!  Seriously, what were they thinking!!  Who is gonna book room at a nice hotel and bring all the kitchenware with them??!!  The place just didn't make sense!\\\\n\\\\nHousekeeping is a 3 at best.  They came and cleaned the rooms, but our tub was dirty.  We had a epsom salt bath the night before and when we got back to our room, we realized that the tub was still had epsom salt stuck to the bottom of it.  The Q-tips and cotton balls weren't replaced and the toiletry in the shower wasn't put away.  All the other housekeeping service did this in every other hotel we stayed in including MGM, Wynn, and Luxor.\\\\n\\\\nThe ONE restaurant that VDARA has is NOT open for dinner.  I can understand why.  The restaurant is just entirely BORING!  They probably can't afford to leave it open, since there may be all of 2 tables booked for the entire place.  \\\\n\\\\nThe BEST thing about Vdara was the spa.  We booked a couple's massage and our masseuse were fantastic.  Really enjoyed that!!\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, this hotel is for guests who are in Vegas strictly for business.  If you want pleasure with your business go somewhere else.  If a non-gaming hotel is what your looking for, Four Seasons may be in order!\\\\n\\\\ni guess you get what you pay for.  The rooms are pretty cheap for what you get.\"},\n",

I went into the store to have batteries and service done on five watches.  While I was there I noticed they started carrying Glycine watches which I've had my eye on for a while.\\\\n\\\\nA young salesperson quoted me a price of $2,900.00 for one of the Airmen Multi-Time Zone watches that they were selling on consignment.   I knew it was a good price but needed to think on it.  When I got home my wife said she would buy it for me for Father's day so I turned right around the same afternoon (less than 30 minutes later) and when back to the store.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I returned, I was told by the salesperson that he misquoted the price and he had actually quoted me cost.  He then said it was $7,875 for the same watch.  I reminded him what he quoted me and offered a price of $3,500 which made him $600 profit and I would still feel like I got a good price.  I felt it was very reasonable of me to do that in light of the salesperson's mistake.  This way, he wins, I win.\\\\n\\\\nThe salesperson left and spoke with David Donaldson the owner and returned with a price of $6,300.  I told him that I drove all the way back specifically based on the $2,900 price I had originally been quoted.  David then came out and told me that the salesman was new (he isn't...he's been there for at least six months as he helped me the last time I had a battery replaced) and that he couldn't afford to sell the watch to me at that price and furthermore he was willing to lose a customer over his salesperson's mistake.  He said he couldn't afford to sell me the watch because he was a small business owner and it would cost him a month's rent.\\\\n\\\\n$3,500 minus $2,900 = $600 profit for a watch that he had less than a week.  Pretty good return in my book.  \\\\n\\\\nI'm in sales and have people work for me too.  When one of my guys quotes a price and it's wrong, I have to eat it.  I may not like it but it's the right thing to do.  It has cost me thousands of dollars before, but it's the right thing to do.  THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. \\\\n\\\\nSo yes Dave you have lost a customer but in the world of online reviews and customer satisfaction, the way you treated me will cost you a lot more in missed business from people who read this review and won't like the way you do business.  It's called opportunity loss and your treatment of me will cost you a lot more than the missed excess profits you lost from being disrespectful and unreasonable with a good customer.  Remember, I offered you a price above cost to be fair and you still treated me poorly.  \\\\n\\\\nI then got a call from them the next day asking me to come pick up the watches I had left there for repair.  Really?  How childish and immature is that?  I gladly picked them up.\\\\n\\\\nI then found the exact Glycine watch and serial number listed for sale for $1,795 on www.chrono24.com by Feel Good Watches, Inc. a Scottsdale, AZ reseller. So the watches weren't even owned by Donaldson to sell, but rather were gray market watches that were put in his store on consignment.  I confirmed this with Feel Good Watches personally who indicated the watches were owned by a third party, most likely another jeweler.  David Donaldson was not only trying to gouge me in price, but he was selling gray market watches himself which I think is funny considering the owner's post below referencing other gray market watch resellers.   This just goes to show they are liars and dishonest.  The owner  makes reference in her response to not being able to sell below cost...the cost was $1,795 dollars which was the price the exact watch was available for sale on chrono24.com.  Secondly...I find it ironic they refer to cost when they in fact didn't even own the watches in the first place.\\\\n\\\\nThe owner has made a statement that the watches were properly marked and price.  This is a lie. There was no price tag on the watch.  I know that because the tag on the watch has a number of 3883 on it which I asked if this was the original price and I was told it was the watch model and serial numbers.  The salesperson then quoted me a price of $2,900 and told me what a great price that was.   The salesperson knowingly quoted me the price and even though he had been there 90 days, I would hardly say he was new.    The salesperson  didn't hesitate at all in quoting me the original price of $2,900.  There was no miscommunication on my part.\\\\n\\\\nBOTTOM LINE.  AS BUSINESS OWNERS YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE LIES YOU CONTINUE TO CREATE.  YOU SHOULD JUST COME CLEAN.  DO NOT BUY A WATCH FROM THIS BUSINESS AS NOT ONLY IS DAVID DONALDSON DISHONEST, BUT SO IS HIS WIFE.  I guess the whole mix up was a blessing in disguise as I would have way overpaid for the watch and I could have gotten it for half what I had offered him in good faith.  Buyer beware.  I'm going to stick with a different brand now and I'll never set foot in this poor business again.  Neither should you.\\\\n\\\\nCONSUMERS BEWARE!\"},\n",

I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.  \\\\n\\\\nOnce I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  \\\\n\\\\nWell......that is not exactly the way it turned out. \\\\n\\\\nI've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  \\\\n\\\\nEach time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  \\\\n\\\\nI'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  \\\\n\\\\nOnce we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  \\\\n\\\\nBy this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR. \\\\n\\\\nI've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller, the prices have gone up, the service has gone south, and now we are no longer loyal customers.\"},\n",

       "               'review': \"Let me just start off by saying that I love buffets.  I've tried them all, from the Rio's Carnival to Red Rock's Feast buffet.  I rarely find a buffet that doesn't impress me, but that is just what happened at Studio B.  It started off just fine, my girlfriend and I got in line and when we came to the cashier she was real nice. We got our discount for using our players card and got in line to be seated and saw the decor of the buffet and it looked real nice. We were then taken to our seat near a window with a nice view of the city.  Nice.  That was the extent of my satisfaction with this buffet.  \\\\nI head to the buffet and I like to scope out all the different types of foods. I first notice that there were no signs above the areas stating the type of culture the food was (i.e. Some places will have a sign or something saying 'AMERICAN' or 'KOREAN').  So I figured I would just have to rely on the signs with the food stating what each item was.  There were none.  Nothing to let me know what food was what.  Didnt know if I was putting Mandarin chicken on my plate or Mongolian pork. Didnt know what the pastas were because there were no labels.  No labels for the soups.  I just had to assume I knew what I was doing.  So, I grab a few familiar foods (can't go wrong with white rice) and head back to my table, only to find people sitting at it.  Huh? I see a waitress and ask her what the deal was and she said they moved us.  Moved us?  WOW! Thats new to me.  So I sit down and our waitress asks what we want to drink, we order 2 diet cokes and begin to eat.  About 10 minutes later (which in Las Vegas buffet time is an hour) I see our waitress loaded with drinks strolling around with a dumbfounded look on her face as to what drinks go where.  She begins to hand off drinks to various tables and with 1 drink left passes by our table when I ask her where our drinks were.  She says 'Oh diet? Ok take this one.'  She gives us her leftover that she couldnt find...and the soda was flat. \\\\nNow for my second plate.  I want meat so I go to the carving station and look at what they have.  I see the turkey and I approach and ask for a couple of slices (Note: I LOVE Thanksgiving, I love turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy and all that).  I get a couple of slices and look around....um...where's the turkey gravy?  To my chagrin, the cook tells me there is none.  WHAT? You have turkey but no gravy??? 'Ya', replied the cook, 'I don't get it either'.  So what am I supposed to drench my stuffing with...wait...there's no stuffing either?  Thats right.  No turkey gravy. No stuffing.  Just dry turkey.  And the mashed potatoes are in a completely different area.  I ask the cook had anyone else asked about there being no labels with any of the food and his response was 'Yesterday just about everyone asked that'.  Now I'm losing hope. \\\\nFinally, I begin to make my way to the dessert area which is a line like you would see at a cafeteria.  50% of it was flan and when finally reaching the only thing that looked appealing, the gelatto, I asked for some.  The lady presented my scoop and instead of asking, 'Anything else' or 'Is that enough' or anything to the sort, instead she RUDELY tells me to please me along.  I felt like I was in the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld.   Funny thing is I had to backtrack the line just to get to the toppings!!! We ate dessert and left for home.  But it doesnt end there.  Our total was about $34 dollars for the both of us after our discount.  However, when we got home and my girlfriend checked her online statement, they had somehow charged her $41!  Ugh...So now we're trying to get this fixed.  \\\\nAll in all, this was the WORST experience I have ever had at any buffet and if it was possible to give it zero stars for wasting my time I would.  Mr. Marnell wants to cut down on outsourcing to other owners and adding multiple investors in his property to ensure better customer service but last night felt more like he was cutting corners.  I do NOT recommend this buffet to anyone.\"},\n",

Well, after staying there for five nights and experiencing all the bullshit we went through, it got dropped down to two stars.

When we get there--\\\\\"we\\'re all out of king beds, we can upgrade you into the west wing for no charge. But a lot of people don\\'t like the west wing, so if you don\\'t like it, we can move you guys tomorrow.\\\\\" Okay fine, we go to the west wing..even though I\\'ve been told by many people the West Wing rooms are shitty. So we get to the room, it\\'s a dingy piece of crap. You walk in and literally walk right into the bathroom. Plus the room is SMALL!  \\\\n\\\\nSo the next day, we call the front desk. They say we can move between 2 and 4pm. So I check back at 2 they tell me to check back at 3:30. I call back at 3:30, \\\\\"okay we can move you to a king room (WHICH IS WHAT WE ORIGINALLY RESERVED!)--however it will be an hour before a bellhop can get your bags.\\\\\" Are you f\\'ing kidding me!??! An hour!!?? Christ, I know the hotel is big, but still! We wound up carrying our bags from the West Wing to the front desk. Anyone who has stayed there knows that\\'s a long freaking walk!  We complained to the front desk and told them at this point, we\\'d rather be staying at South Point (where we usually stay.) They got a manager and upgraded us to a suite.\\\\n\\\\nSo we get to the new room, turn the A/C on full blast and head out for our anniversary dinner at the fabulous T-Bones Steak House in Red Rock (read my review for that!)  We get back to the room around 11:00pm and it feels like we walked into a goddamn sauna! I call the front desk to let them know our A/C is not working. Okay,  we\\'ll have someone right up. Couldn\\'t give me a time frame. So now it\\'s midnight, we\\'re both tired so we call back and tell them to forget about it. Unbelievable. The A/C works, but it worked half-assed.

We also had no Do Not Disturb thing for the door, so I made one myself. If I called the front desk to ask for any of these things to be fixed, I\\'d probably be still waiting.\\\\n\\\\nOh it gets better. The kicker was the next night when we get into the elevator. There are like four people on the elevator, we are on the 11th floor. The four other people get off at 6. The elevator goes to 10 and then DROPS two floors. My wife and I had our lives flashing before our eyes. The elevator made a creaking noise and just dropped!

Maybe we were just spoiled with Sushi Land back when we lived in Oregon, but this place is so below par we cannot imagine how it has so many good reviews. All the rolls there are tiny, I mean microscopic. It might actually be a better value to go to a normal sushi place than eat here. Since the rolls were so small and thin they had virtually no taste to them at all. I have never had to rely on soy sauce and ginger to flavor sushi so much in all my life. Each roll had so little fish, it might as well not have even had any at all. \\\\n\\\\nNow before you go thinking \\\\\"Well what do you expect at $1 - $2 a plate?\\\\\" Better, much better, in fact we have experienced sushi a thousand times better at Sushi Land, another conveyor style sushi restaurant for the same prices, but with more sushi and of much better flavor and quality. \\\\n\\\\nAlso upon inspecting the menu, several rolls had the same ingredients, just in different order, which the same name rolls in other places we have been to had a good variety in the ingredients to them.\\\\n\\\\nThey were so busy when we got there that the poor waitresses were running around like chickens without heads, they had almost no time to be attentive. \\\\nThey are understaffed for sure.\\\\n\\\\nLastly the women\\'s restroom was quite dirty when we were there, and they weren\\'t even open for more than two hours at that point. \\\\n\\\\nBottom line, very bland rolls at a price that actually makes them a rip-off.

The best sushi we have had thus far in Phoenix is Harumi Sushi, but they are not cheap.'},\n",

The lines are quicker, smoother, and shorter. We went on a Friday from 2 to 7 p.m. and I was surprised at how little we had to wait in each line. While last year the lifeguards would stand and watch you struggle your tube out of the rides and to the next person yourself, this year they quickly take your tube from you and give it to the next person so you don't have to...awesome! Love this.\\\\n\\\\n2. Faster pacing overall by the lifeguards in moving the lines along. For example, on the ride with the blue mat next to Canyon Cliffs, they now have numbers that the next riders up stand on behind each slide, eliminating a step for when it's your turn. \\\\n\\\\n3. The new Tornado is awesome!!!!\\\\n\\\\n4. I love that they have so many refillable food/drink items. Not only can you buy refillable drink bottles still, but you can now buy refillable ice cream dishes and icee cups for pretty reasonable prices.\\\\n\\\\nComplaints I Have:\\\\n\\\\n1. Lifeguards should wear watches or there should ve a clock we can see somewhere in the park. Wierd how lifeguards on duty don't even know what time it is when you ask them.\\\\n\\\\n2. The gift shop floor gets wet obviously so it becomes slippery and I even almost slipped and fell on it before. Although I did bring this up to a rude clerk as well as a manager last season, nothing has been done about it even to this day. A non-slip mat you'd think would be an easy solution.\\\\n\\\\n3. Slow food lines.\\\\n\\\\n4. Cold, gross food. The pizza is pretty okay though and the fries are okay if they're fresh.\\\\n\\\\n5. The water seems extra dirty...seems like they could have better filters.\\\\n\\\\n6. Last years gold and regular season passes both allowed you 6 free friend passes to bring a friend anytime you wanted. This year the gold pass only lets you bring a friend for free once a month and the regular pass allows you to bring a friend once a month for a fee of $15.....bummer. I loved last years friend benefits way more. Nonetheless, the seasin passes are pretty affordable since you gets your moneys worth with just two visits. I just wish our friends could come with us more.\\\\n\\\\n7. The customer service was horrible last year and it has only improved slightly. Many of the lifeguards seem to have careless teenager attitudes most of the time even when you just ask them a simple question.\\\\n\\\\n8. This new WNW just doesn't serm as big and excellent as the one we had here in Las Vegas when I was a kid...could be because everything seems bigger and better when you're a kid...not sure. \\\\n\\\\nEven though I do have a few complaints and WNW still has some room for improvement, I am still happy to have it back to give kids something to do in this very hot city. They really should have never taken it away.\"},\n",

For over ten years I was fully satisfied with them and always gave them good reviews. My credit is not the best because of a horrible divorce I went through but Carmax has always given me a great interest rate. Last year as a matter of fact at this same Henderson location, I purchased a 2007 Toyota Corolla S and got an outstanding interest rate. Well I am here to tell you that Carmax has reached an all-time low because they DO NOT follow through with their promises.\\\\n\\\\nSaturday afternoon my husband and I went to the Henderson Carmax and met George Baker, Carmax Salesperson. He was helpful in directing us to cars that would meet our needs. He asked if we would be trading in our 1994 Ford Ranger in fair condition to put towards the purchase of the car we decided upon - a 2010 Nissan Versa. George promised us that in the event we found a private buyer for the Ranger that offered more than Carmax\\'s $500 assessed trade in value (WITHIN 5 DAYS of the purchase of our Carmax car), that we could in fact get our trade in back from them. We hastily agreed to the low assessed value of $500 with the intention of checking with a potential private buyer we know to see if he wanted it and getting back with George in the event we were offered more. My husband told George that we would get back with him as soon as we knew anything. We put $1000 cash and $1500 (on our VISA bank card via P.O.S transaction) down on the car, in addition to the $500 trade in value for a total of a $3000 deposit on the Nissan Versa. The car\\'s sticker price was $13,700.\\\\n\\\\nMonday morning (Day 3) at work, I got a phone call from the Carmax cash office saying that we would need to go get the car smogged because it \\\\\"just\\\\\" expired. \\\\\"Smogged? Doesn\\'t the car come with a smog upon purchase?\\\\\", I asked. \\\\\"Yes, it does..\\\\\" the office associate explained, \\\\\"but it somehow just slipped through the cracks.\\\\\" I was then directed to take time off from work to bring the car into Carmax for a smog before they close at 4pm OR I could go get the car smogged at another smog service provider and get reimbursed.\\\\n\\\\u00a0\\\\nTuesday (Day 4) my husband drove the car to his place of work. He decided to have it smogged at a smog booth close to his work during his lunch break. Upon arrival, the service attendant told him that the Dealer was in fact responsible for the smog by law and that he could not give us the required smog test. At this point we were not feeling very comfortable with the ethics behind this sale. I called Carmax and told them that we were bring the car back because we were still within the 5-Day grace period and we didn\\'t approve of the way things were handled.\\\\n\\\\u00a0\\\\nI was forced to leave work early, do a car switch with my husband and hurry back to Carmax before the cash office closed. Carmax first hassled me about the gas tank not being full, then they slowly processed my return over the period of 3 hours. I asked if our 1994 Ford Ranger trade in was still on the lot so I could get it back since we were told that we could reclaim our trade in as long as it was within 5 days of purchase. Carmax refused to give the Ranger back. They instead gave me a $500 check. I was told that the remainder of my deposit would be mailed to me within 2 weeks, despite their own Policy that states all credit card deposit refunds shall be credited back to the credit card used to make the deposit. They told me that the charge to my VISA was not a credit card transaction. I called my bank and verified that they did in fact make a P.O.S. charge to my VISA card. I threatened to call the police and was getting very upset with the \\\\\"manager\\\\\" that was left to deal with me. I asked for the General Manager. They said the General Manager was \\\\\"not in today\\\\\" and brushed me off. Our Salesperson was nowhere to be found after this occurrence and no one would give us any sort of reconciliation on matters which were unresolved.\\\\n\\\\nWednesday (Day 5) I sent a text to our salesperson who so conveniently disappeared during my battle with the Carmax cash office, explaining to him that Carmax was refusing to give us our Ford Ranger back regardless of what was promised. I asked him what was going on. His exact reply was, \\\\\"(1/2) If I knew in advance that your plan was to take advantage of a possible return re-purchase, then I would\\'ve partnered with a manager concerning your trade. (2/2) I was unaware that it would be a straight return which means the trade goes through our normal processing and may not be at our dealership.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTake advantage of a possible return re-purchase? How would we have even known that Carmax was going to sell us an unsmogged car? Why would you not prepare for something other than the \\\\\"straight return\\\\\" after making a promise like that? Clearly, we are criminals plotting to take advantage of Carmax.\\\\n\\\\nThis ten year customer has walked out of Carmax for the last time.'},\n",

I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \\\\n\\\\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.\"},\n",

However, after thinking back on today's events I feel compelled to issue a stern warning.  Since Autumn left last fall, it seems as though the staff has been different each time I went in for work.  This in itself is not an issue, why I write is to offer you warning that your experience will likely be ruined by the inhospitable staff who excel in condescension while offering a ham-handed piercing technique.  After having both nipples pierced, a labret, an industrial, nose-ring, tongue, and ears spaced, and a multitude of other piercings, I am aware of what to expect when I decide to do further body modification.  \\\\n\\\\nThe staff that was working was, simply put, rude.  They were discussing disdainfully the questions that earlier clients had tendered and when they did take a break from verbally assailing these customers to help me they were short and discourteous.  Since I was there for a tragus and not to make friends I tried to dismiss this effrontery.  While the mood temporarily lightened once I went back for the piercing, the young lady with dreadlocks couldn't help but talk about herself for the entire time coming off as narcissistic and  somewhat arrogant.  Again, I soldiered on as I was terribly excited about the piercing despite the staff.  If the verbal treatment of the staff wasn't sufficient to turn me off to Sadu permanently the piercer's brutish handling lacked any semblance of finesse.   So I  would give her skills  five stars -- five stars that had each collapsed into a black hole and merged to form the largest black hole in the universe.  \\\\n\\\\nIf you cannot afford a professional dominatrix to mistreat you I would thoroughly recommend Sadu, if on the other hand you are looking for a positive lasting experience I would go elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\np.s.   to be completely fair they have great jewelry, but nothing you can't find online for the same price.

Last year they insisted on having my ATM card on record even though I was paying cash but assured me that if there were any charges made to my account all I would have to do is call the corporate office. sure enough the first of the next month they charged the membership fee to my account. Every month for six months thereafter they charged my account. I sent emails and called their corporate office countless times during that time, never any response. Ultimately, I had to handle it through my financial institution and have them block them as an authorized retailer for accessing my account. This year I went in for my same pre-summer tanning sessions and they told me I owed them over $400. Once again I explain that I had never been interested in a membership and have never signed up for one. I was able to contact the corporate office at that point in time and got the matter straightened out, all charges were removed because I had never used any other sessions other than the month I had paid for (which is what I told the girl I was purchasing in the first place). I went back into the salon once again paid cash and started tanning, figuring I would put my best foot forward. I went in the following month and paid cash once again for my month of tanning, I just went in the store to try to tan and they informed me that I owe them over $200 for my unpaid \\\\\"membership\\\\\" for the past two months. I explained to the girl I did not have a membership & I did not authorize you to access my account. I have paid cash anytime I was interested in tanning sessions.

The parking spaces on the North side had broken glass all over the place and with traffic behind me I had to drive through it. Not cool. Then after getting a space I can't even get to the door because the hordes of people are gawking at a Henderson PD Parking Enforcement officer who was circling like a vulture waiting to write tickets. Once inside I had a foot run over by a shopping cart and in the bulk foods section I had 2 different people ram me in the derriere with a cart in under 90 seconds. Hello? I'm 6'4 and wearing a red shirt. It's not like they couldn't see me! I know I'm not a small guy. But I'm trying to lose weight so having a steel shopping cart attached to my rear is not going to help me any. \\\\n\\\\nSo after extracting myself from the shopping carts of mayhem I head over to the deli counter. I ask them a simple question about the source of their meats and I get the classic I don't have a clue shrug. Ugh! After fighting the madhouse to get through the rest of the store for what I need I finally get up to the front to check out. I have 16 items...I thought it was 15, my bad. Self check out is for 15 items..it's posted on the overhead sign. I get in line and next thing I know I have some woman counting my items and saying I have 1 too many. Fine, I take an item out of the cart and set it to the side and she's like sorry, you have to go to another line. I tell her I now have 15 items, she's like you need to go to another line. At that point I'm at thermonuclear launch mode (this is ultra rare for me) and I'm like this is ridiculous. I raise my voice and tell her and a lot of others in earshot: Let me tell you how I'm going to save at WinCo...I'm leaving, and I WON'T BE BACK! On my way out the door a couple that saw what happened said good for me, that I did the right thing. Not that I needed the validation but still...enough is enough. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe when someone carves a replica of the Taj Mahal in ice in Hell, Michigan will I ever step foot in that store again. 1 star, and a bump to the EEK! I THINK NOT / Worst of Las Vegas list and an email to WinCo Corporate is my response. \\\\n\\\\nFor the sake of readability I've left out even more bad things that happened on this trip...don't even get me started on the bakery!

The wings were $9 for a basket. I said the basket better be pretty big and made of gold for $9 and change. The wings were standard buffalo wings with that buttery, vinegary orange glaze, served with ranch and carrot and celery sticks. On his second wing, he bit into a cool spot.

There was absolutely nothing Hawaiian about it. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered a Hula burger on wheat, like a mushroom swiss + extra charge for avocado ($8 + 1). My favorite thing about this place is that they\\'ll substitute any beef patty with a veggie patty, free of charge. They also sub chicken breast burgers for +$1. \\\\n\\\\nBf ordered a Kilauea burger ($8). He wanted his burger rare, but our waitress told us they don\\'t go less than medium. Hold the phone. Why is this? It takes less effort to cook a burger rare. Because you cook it less. So why in Zeus\\' name can\\'t they cook it less? We didn\\'t make a big deal, beyond the Zeus speech and he just got it medium. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I looked at his burger, I couldn\\'t tell the difference between the wheat bread and the thoroughly-cooked beef. Brown brown brown. \\\\n\\\\nMy burger was good. But if you screw up a veggie burger, you need to kill yourself. My burger smelled so buttery. The butter from my sauteed mushrooms soaked into the top bun. The whole thing was mushy from the moisture of the mushrooms, the mayo, and veggie patty ... and it was wonderful. There\\'s a part of me that enjoys mushy burgers. I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork in the end. Its like the middle of the cinnamon bun, all messy, but that\\'s where the biggest concentration of flavor is. Oh, yeah, and I eat my burgers in concentric circles. \\\\n\\\\nThe fries. A travesty to fried foods. They were like greenish. They were thicker than shoestring and flavorless and dry. But they\\'re not cooked in lard and have no trans fats. Honestly, if I\\'m eating fries, they better be cooked in lard and taste like pig guts and I don\\'t care about the trans fats. They\\'re french fries goddamnit.

We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\\\\n\\\\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \\\\\"lunch menu\\\\\" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he\\'ll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \\\\\"Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\\\\\".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.

The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and the best part of our experience here. I would recommend it. I ordered the chili on the side instead of on top of my sandwich. Good call because I didn't like the chili at all. Everything else we ordered was mediocre. Rib tips weren't very tasty. The sides were a disappointment and here's why - melted styrofoam! Gross! I dumped the baked mac and cheese onto my plate to find the styrofoam cup was melted on the inside! That CAN'T be healthy! Same happened with the sweet potato casserole. Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. The baked beans also came in a styrofoam cup which didn't melt and tasted just ok. I know this place's roots are from a food truck, but it's time to get rid of the styrofoam! It's literally IN my food AND not earth-friendly. And you don't even need the styrofoam! The sides could be placed directly on the plate. Texas toast would be better if they buttered and seasoned BOTH sides of the bread. Fun to see Kool-Aid on the beverage menu and the smoker right out front!

A very nice touch.  However, not until we had eaten most of the desert did a new female server come over and ask if we wanted coffee.

After reading all the lovely reviews I was so excited to take my husband and child to a place near our new digs, to prove that we hadn\\'t moved far away from good food experiences. We knew that the outside was a strip mall locale, we don\\'t care. We knew the inside was going to look like it did, we don\\'t care. We go to places because of food, service and price. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we went they were working on the one entrance so we entered on the far side. There were two people eating and a few children running about playing. My first thought was great, this is a friendly, family place and light crowd would mean attentive service. We didn\\'t know if we should seat ourselves, so we walked to the silverware table where we saw menu\\'s and stood for a moment.  Three times servers walked right past us and ignored our presence. Other workers were in the kitchen area, but no one noticed us. \\\\n\\\\nI whispered, \\\\\"Maybe we should get menus and just sit down?\\\\\" So we took three menu\\'s and as I turned around one of the servers came up and made motion for us to sit right there at this huge circle table.  A very large table, but we slid into the corner and he took drink orders from us then dissappeared.\\\\n\\\\nWe sat. We sat some more. He walked by twice carrying water. Another server walked by twice, once with food, once with dishes. They greeted two more tables and brought them menus and took their orders. A server came and poured three water glasses for our table and I interrupted him asking about our drink order. He said something I didn\\'t understand and turned away.  We sat. \\\\n\\\\nFinally I said, \\\\\"Excuse me, please...\\\\\" I got the attention of a different server and we asked about our drink order which he took again and we didn\\'t want to wait any longer and gave our food order as well. Just in case they\\'d never come back. I told the server we were new to this cuisine and would need some help. My husband just wanted to leave. I coerced him to stay, it\\'s going to be fabulous Pho I said remembering the wonderful Yelp reviews. The food would soothe him. I smiled smugly. We ordered several dishes all recommended in Yelp reviews. Spring rolls, two Pho\\'s and the Ban Xeo for my egg and shrimp loving child.\\\\n\\\\n15 minutes later two drinks and some plates of leaves and garnishes were placed on the table. No drink for me and no way to get the garnish plate persons attention. We sat. \\\\\"Are we supposed to eat these,\\\\\" asked my husband?  I said , \\\\\"I believe they go in the soup when it comes.\\\\\" But after another 15 minutes of nothing else arriving, he started to make a mini salad. Several more tables had come in, everyone else had their food. The two tables who came after us were finishing up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This is Bullshit, \\\\\" I muttered to my husband, and just then the crepe and the Pho\\'s came out. I was starting to see a trend here. Just when you get to the point where you want to leave they finally do something to make you stay. We were starving and we didn\\'t want to drive around for another place, just eat and go at this point. It was getting late. I hadn\\'t eaten my garnishes so I shared them with my husband. My daughter\\'s crepe was extra crispy bordering on too dark and she didn\\'t know how to eat it, so she sort of plucked the little shrimps she found out of it.  \\\\\"It\\'s not egg mom\\\\\", she said all grumbly. \\\\\"It\\'s Vietmanese egg I said, \\\\\" as if I knew.  \\\\n\\\\\"Well then I don\\'t like Vietmanese food.\\\\\" Sigh.

They really need to remove this offer from yelp because it is quite deceiving. Now on to the food; we ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni/sausage & 1/2 chicken/mushroom. The crust was crispy on some pieces & soggy on others. The sauce was a bit bland, it really could use some flavor. The chicken also didn't taste that great. My husband said the pepperoni/sausage was just meh. Overall we didn't really enjoy the pizza. It was pricey & the quality was not that great.

I have had tapas before, and although the plates are small, they usually pack a nice flavor and you leave feeling not stuffed, but satisfied. The food was not bad, but we left feeling pretty hungry still. To start we ordered the goat cheese balls in the truffle honey, which were very good, but there were literally only 2 and they were sooooo small! Definitely felt ripped off here. We also ordered the roasted eggplant dip with pita and that was pretty good. We then ordered the salmon, sea bass and a side of asparagus, heeding the waitresses warning about how small the servings were. We couldn't really taste the asparagus because they were pretty burnt, and the salmon came out pretty raw (I ordered it medium). The seabass seemed okay. I would probably go back here for drinks because the bar area looked pretty cool, and in the outside area where we ate they had couches and it was a cool lounge area. I liked the decor and general feel of the place and our server was super friendly and attentive. But I definitely would not order the sangria again, tasted kind of funky and lacked flavor, and the strawberry inside looked kind of scary.\"},\n",

Many times, when I first drive up to a place and I see 3 or more of the staff outside the back door smoking cigarettes I will hop back in my car and leave, but this place had really good write ups and we were in the mood for some super Italian food after working all day so we decided to give it a try anyway. We were readily greeted and seated, and water was brought to the table in no time at all. We had a few minutes to look over the menu. My husband and I decided we would each get a salad and then share an entree of linguine with clam sauce. I ordered the mixed green salad which was supposed to have greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives. I kid you not, there was only about one fourth of ONE olive on my whole salad and there was no onion whatsoever. There were greens, tomatoes and three half slices of cucumber with a tasty balsamic dressing for $8. What it should have cost was $4 at the most. My husband ordered the arugula salad topped with Gorgonzola cheese. The arugula greens were nice and fresh and the he enjoyed the balsamic dressing as well BUT his salad only had a minuscule amount of Gorgonzola on it ( three small pieces to be exact) $9  I must give credit where credit is due, their bread was really quite good. It was a flat bread that seemed freshly baked right out of their wood fired oven and then lightly brushed with olive oil and dusted with black pepper. Then linguine comes out. First thing I notice is there is no spoon served with the pasta dish. Well, I figured out real soon why there was no spoon because there was NO SAUCE (unless a tablespoon of sauce counts) also, about one third of the clam shells that were served with the pasta were void of any clams. One of the clams was still shut too. So, the tablespoon of sauce we did get was tasty, but really...how hard is it to add a bit of garlic, butter and white wine and put it on the pasta....there was no sauce! The whole meal was so sad because components of it were so good but then it was so messed up by the huge oversights. The homemade pasta noodles had delightful flavor yet so very very dry. I wanted to try the tiramisu for desert but by this point I knew what to expect so we passed. So very very sad. Bummer!

The fries, while seemingly expensive, were very good and provided enough (at the \\\\\"little fries\\\\\" level) to serve at least two, not three, people. The restaurant was clean and enjoyable. \\\\n\\\\nOne thing about the fries: if you are truly unable to digest flour, they coat their fries with it. I don\\'t know if they offer a gluten free fry, but you should ask. \\\\n\\\\nNow to the burger. Oh my. I ordered \\\\\"all the way\\\\\" which is the cheeseburger with everything (onions, tomato, pickles, mushrooms, ketchup, mustard ,etc). I didn\\'t really want mushrooms but it was easier to say \\\\\"the works\\\\\". The propaganda for the restaurant (and many of the reviews on this site) promote the idea of a burger made from quality products and cooked to order. The burger was cooked to order\\\\n\\\\nThe burger was okay. juicy and thick, but part of a parceled package, not made from local meat or hand pressed. The mushrooms were, sadly, canned and tasteless. The tomato slice (singular) was nice and seemed fresh but it was swallowed up by the other toppings. The cheese, in Wisconsin no less, was basically Velveeta. The worst aspect was the bun: a cheap white bread sesame seed covered bun. It managed to hold together to the 6 minutes of processing time in eating, but was completely unenjoyable and generally complimented the cheapness of the mushrooms and cheese. \\\\n\\\\nFor the price asked, a much better burger could be had at the Red Shed (just a block away) or Dotty\\'s Dumplings, The Nitty Gritty (also within a few blocks. I get that the State Street location pushes up the rent and the cost, but I can\\'t believe the other reviewers are eating at the same place.'},\n",

Who say\\'s, \\\\\"I\\'m not sure\\\\\" and walks away? Really? Seriously, it\\'s a guessing game here. Our flight home was in the late hours of the night. We came into the airport pretty early and the line was mildly short. My bf tried to check us in but it froze on him. Wtf man! He tried finding a worker from the airport but no one was available. I mean no one was there. He tried asking for help from the workers at Hawaiian Air and they didn\\'t help either.  He finally found one after searching for at least ten minutes. By this time, the line for the bag check in got longer. Thank goodness I was standing in line already, or so I thought. After the first worker walked away, my bf found another guy (another 10 or 15 minutes wait) and this one told us to stand in the shorter line because we didn\\'t check in properly. We were finally relieved that someone knew what they were doing. Yea right... Mind you, that short line or the line I was in had no sign of what each line was for. \\\\n\\\\nWe moved to the shorter line which only had two couples. OHH MUH GAWD! We stood in line for 45 minutes. Everyone who came after us on the other line had bypassed us. Not only did the airport worker screw us over, the Hawaiian Airline workers also screwed us over by making us wait 45 minutes. The only reason why they started helping us was because I yelled out for everyone to hear that all of us had been waiting for 45 minutes. I got a reply back from the Hawaiian Air worker; \\\\\"please be patient, we are busy\\\\\".  I never ever yell out in public places but it was just too much for me.   We finally got checked in and had only 20 minutes to spare before they opened the gates for our flight. \\\\n\\\\nLuckily for me I hated Las Vegas.

My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \\\\n\\\\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad.

We decided to try this place, Swish, to get something a little different. In the end, we were extremely disappointed and wish we could recommend it, but just can not. \\\\n\\\\nDecor and ambiance are OK. Waitress was nice. Peach tea was good. Prices fair.\\\\n\\\\nThe major problem was the food. We ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki. Firstly, the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored. Secondly, the chicken was in chunks, not sliced, and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits. The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either. The beef was ok, and sliced appropriately, and I ate that in the shabu shabu, but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing. I like cabbage, but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodles.\\\\n\\\\nThe minor problem was the hot pots. They were extremely shallow, and the waitress didn't pay attention to them, so they were constantly boiling down, and at multiple points were down to almost nothing, so we couldn't cook our food.\\\\n\\\\nI left hungry, and sad.\"},\n",

Riding this bus can be a pretty shitty experience. \\\\n1. It\\'s riddiculously uncomfortable. True the seats have a soft plush cover, but look at the way they\\'re organized and proportioned, they don\\'t give you a lot of leg room, or arm room for that matter. Whoever designed the bus interior should be thrown in front of a bus. \\\\n2. They get riddiculously crowded. Considering there\\'s so many of them running at once, they really need to put a limit on how many people can be allowed on the bus at once, it\\'s truly riddiculous how cramped that bus can get, the seating organization doesn\\'t help either.\\\\n3. At every stop, even if there aren\\'t any people there, the bus stops and waits for about 5 minutes. What the hell are you waiting for? If someone wasn\\'t at the bus stop in time, that\\'s their fault, besides, there\\'s probably another Duece right behind you, and it\\'s not like the bus has anymore space to pick up more passengers anyway.\\\\n4. The bus drives at tour bus speed. Considering that it\\'s the only bus on the Strip, locals and workers have to use this bus as well, they have more important destinations to get to at certain times, while these tourists are on vacation and have all the time to do whatever the hell they want. If a local is late for their job or an appointment because of how slow this bus is going, that\\'s just downright unfair, and the driver should be sued. Even when Strip traffic is at it\\'s worst, driving from the Flamingo to the Venetian shouldn\\'t take anymore than 10 minutes. 15 tops. Not almost 30. And any attempts to make this a sight seeing/tour bus is borderline futile, considering that most of these buses have screen coating ads which makes everything outside look all fuzzy and distorted. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s some suggestions:\\\\n1. Do a complete remodel of the bus interiors, so the seat organization is actually functional. \\\\n2. If all the seats are filled, no more than 20 people should be allowed on the bus at a time. \\\\n3. You know what, scratch all that. Keep the Duece Bus exactly the same for the TOURISTS. How about adding a route of regular buses for the Strip that locals and workers can use, with designated stops for the Deuce and the regular CAT bus so everyone will be able to tell the difference. These buses will run at normal speed so people who have more important places to go will get there on time, since there\\'s no tourists, there will be no epic crowds of people standing on top of each other and you\\'ll have to pay regular fare of $2.50 for a day pass, not $5.00, which is the type of money tourists have to blow, not everyday people. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m actually not surprised that so many people think there is nothing else to Las Vegas besides the Strip. I mean, after they see how things like The Duece work, obviously it seems totally unreasonable for people to actually thrive here.'},\n",

If you are going to dine finely, go to Aria for the hot new menus.  The restaurants in Mandalay Bay embody the ignorant Americanism that is Vegas - boring, ethnocentric, and bland.\\\\n\\\\n*Rooms: Egad Watson! These rooms suck. The pictures and the crap lighting create the perception of a nicely designed room, but it's all a house of cards underneath.  Bed sheets that don't fit properly, bath towels that feel like sandpaper against your skin, a cruel lack of bathroom countertop, chipped paint, and lame water pressure.  If I'm paying a premium for the room, I want to be able to rinse out my conditioner in 5 minutes or less.

Ok granted I have only had about 20 pedis in my entire life, and only two other places to compare it with, and my feet are awfully ticklish but I really don\\'t think I am the worlds pickiest, princess. I had been going here for two years  because it is right next to Massage Envy. One stop pampering huh? You would think. and  it took me a while to write a review because I could not put my finger on what it was about this place I hated but I think I have it now. I went 4 or 5 times and I alway felt very uncomfortable here. I wasn\\'t sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was a  member of a cattle herd. In and out, no smile,  no service. They were always in a rush to get me done and onto the next person waiting. Welllllll,  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap SOOO, since I am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that I am the paying customer? Oh well,  I kind of blew it off and figured all places were like this.( Even though the other two places I had been to in the past were not  like this)  I continued to go because this place was a little cheaper and more convenient.  I went back a few more times until The last time I went in this past winter. That was the last straw. ( Plus they raised their prices!) The girl was so rude to me for no reason known. I was very nice to her and she just kept ignoring me and hurting me. I asked her to go easier and she did not  and rolled her eyes. At the end of the pedicure she did not give me the sandals they usually give for drying time and  tried to put my shoes back on to soon and smeared the polish on my big toe. OMG she acted like it was all my fault. She actually got mad at me! She  rolled her eyes and got really bent out of shape!I couldn\\'t believe it. She huffed and puffed back to get the polish remover and mumbled when she had to repaint my toe. After she repainted my toe she again tried to put my shoe back on without any dry time.  Well somehow my foot tensed up as I tried to help her out by pushing my foot a little into the shoe and she had the nerve to yell at me and slapped my foot. She barked \\\\\"STOP IT!\\\\\" and told me to cut it out and relax my foot and again with the rolling of her eyes with a side helping of attitude. What is this all about?????Are all pedi place like this I wonder. Follow up- Months later-  Ok, so today my friend tells me she  had a pedi yesterday and the lady told her her feet were ugly. \\\\n(They are not,. She is a gorgeous gal all around. However,  either way HELLO???? Are you really gonna tell your client that? JEEEEEZZ LOUISE).  Lo and behold, yup, you guessed it, the same place! YIKES!!!! RUN AWAY!

When the sandwich came, my sister who was also with me said the following: \\\\\"Your sandwich looks like something they would sell at a gas station in South Carolina\\\\\".  I think that was a completely fair assessment.  For a $11 club sandwich and 45 min wait, I had pictured a sandwich carefully crafted with shaved ham and turkey (as advertised on the menu).  What I got was a slab of ham steak slapped on two pieces of bread.   I\\'m positive I could have made a better sandwich from my play kitchen as a 3 year old.  \\\\n\\\\nMy wife ordered a burger medium well.  It came out about as rare as I\\'ve ever seen meat.

Except for what I bought, most everything was not cute. Third, where were the summer dresses??? All I saw were shirts, shirts, and more shirts. I saw one...yes one...summer dress in the whole store and it was hideous. Fourth, what store doesn't take American Express??? When the cashier told me they didn't accept AmEx, I was stunned. I mean, I know AmEx has high fees, but I think it's the first store in three years that I have been in that doesn't take it. Fifth, the layout sucks. \\\\n\\\\nI appreciate that it was a clean store (I had visions that it would resemble Old Navy...picked over and messy), but the merchandise selection was disappointing. It's a 1.5 star H&M, but I'm rounding up to two since I walked away with three cute shirts. If you need your H&M fix while in Vegas, go to the one down the street.\"},\n",

They were very busy, the salon was clean, and I was quickly seen by someone at the front desk. All good signs. However, it quickly became apparent looks can be deceiving.\\\\n\\\\nI came in for a full set of gels. The first thing that happened was that the nail technician argued with me about acrylics instead for no discernible reason. I repeatedly said no, and he just kept saying, \\\\\"acrylics?\\\\\" I would say, \\\\\"No! Gel!\\\\\" eventually loud enough to draw attention from everyone getting pedis. I asked if there was a reason I couldn\\'t have gels, and he just kept repeating, \\\\\"I\\'ll give you acrylics.\\\\\" I should have walked away then, but I\\'d driven far enough I didn\\'t want to have wasted the gas and time. Eventually, he settled on, \\\\\"gel powder okay?\\\\\" Gel powder is NOT gel. I knew that, but I was sick of arguing, and accepted it.\\\\n\\\\nHe did not ask me if I wanted rounded or flat tips. When he started making them flat and I said I wanted round tips, he said, \\\\\"okay, last, afterwards,\\\\\" so I figured he\\'d round them all at once. Nope. He left them flat. When it became apparent that\\'s what he was doing, I tried saying again that I wanted round tips, and again I was met with an answer that implied he\\'d fix them at the end. When he declared me done and sent me to the dryer, I said one last time that I had asked him for rounded tips, which he IGNORED!!! And just walked away!\\\\n\\\\nOn top of the absolutely horrible service and failure to listen to me OR explain why I couldn\\'t get gels (something I\\'ve never had a problem with anywhere before), the nail job itself was absolutely horrendous! They were crooked, half of them COVER my cuticles, and far too bulky. I measured; each nail is almost 3 millimeters thick. Go find a measuring tape and see how thick 3 millimeters is. It\\'s like having clogs strapped to my fingertips.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe their other nail technicians are better; maybe their pedis are amazing. I wouldn\\'t know, and I\\'m never finding out. Be sure to steer clear if you\\'re looking for fake nails. AWFUL!'},\n",

We spoke with John Obiniana, the manager, about our repeated poor service and he responded with saying there was nothing he could do and had an overall rude and uncaring tone and response to anything we discussed. The rooms in this hotel are very nice and the location is perfect for the money but I have never stayed in a hotel with this poor of customer service and unhelpful staff.

This is what we were doing when we last rented a room in June. I apologize for the great detail, but I want you to understand what a horrific experience we had.\\\\n\\\\nOur reservation was for one night to celebrate my sister\\'s 21st birthday. We had two rooms, and pulled up together with our bags in tow to the valet. We waited for about 5 minutes, and were finally approached by a valet attendant, who aggressively asked what we were doing there. We stated that we have reservations and were there to check in. He responded with a very robotic and rude, \\\\\"Show me your bags or your reservation.\\\\\" We told him we had our bags in the trunk, and he continued to be aggressive. I understand they probably have a lot of people taking advantage of the valet service, however, as soon as he realized that we were not one of those people, he should have turned that attitude off. He did not. \\\\n\\\\nAs I started to unload my things and my baby, I asked for a caddy to tote our luggage on. They told me I am not allowed to use it. I had to ask why before they would offer me a baggage attendant that would help me. When the baggage attendant approached, I was really hoping he would turn things around. I was sadly disappointed. I loaded our bags onto the caddy, and he was writing, and had never said anything to me or my group, so I assumed we were finished. I proceeded to head inside. He came after me about 3 minutes later, and held his hands out and asked, \\\\\"How am I going to get these to you if you don\\'t wait a minute?\\\\\" I followed him back out to the valet area. He then accosted me for placing an item on the luggage caddy that wasn\\'t \\\\\"in a proper bag\\\\\" (it was a box of crackers...) and he rolled his eyes and grabbed a plastic bag and placed the crackers in the bag. He then asked me to count my bags. I did, and I reported the number. He began to explain that the bags could take up to an hour to get to our room, and that me taking them myself was still not an option. In that case, I decided I would need my diaper bag. I removed it from the caddy, and he rolled his eyes again and proceeded to dramatically rip up the ticket and said \\\\\"We need to count again.\\\\\" He then proceeded to tell me that when I got to the room, I would need to call them to bring the bags up. I asked him to just send them now, since we were on our way out, and he said \\\\\"We don\\'t do that. You have to be there to accept them.\\\\\" When I finally was released by the baggage king, we headed to our rooms to \\\\\"accept\\\\\" our bags that they wouldn\\'t allow us to take by ourselves. I waited on hold for 4 minutes before anyone answered and they demanded a code that was on my paper. I had a baby in my arms, so I asked them to look it up by our room number or reservation since our last name had been taken, but they said they required the code. I told them to wait a second so I could dig it out, and they told me I would have to call back when I was ready...\\\\n\\\\nThe rest of the experience continued in that direction. We made a point to avoid all restaurants, bars and gambling in the Golden Nugget since the experience had been so consistent. There is clearly some type of management issue that the staff is not happy with, and as a customer, I felt it. We will not be returning, and we have recommended that our friends and family avoid it as well.

On the strength of the Yelp reviews, my partner and I made consecutive appointments for our annual exams. Neither of us has serious eye issues, but we find that our prescriptions now change on pretty much a yearly basis. Dr. Carlsson seems nice enough, but there were a couple of red flags right off the bat.\\\\n\\\\nThe first had to do with my contact lenses. Carlsson charges a $115 \\\\\"contact lens fitting fee.\\\\\" I\\'ve been wearing contacts for about five years now and have never been charged such a fee. Being new to the area, we thought maybe this was standard procedure in Arizona. Nope. Turns out that when the Carlsson clinic submitted the expense to our insurance (I\\'m a public employee, so we have EXCELLENT benefits), they rejected it as a \\\\\"qualified expense.\\\\\" In other words, it\\'s not a fee that insurance companies typically pay.\\\\n\\\\nSince we were already in for $115, we decided to try and make the best of the situation. Dr. Carlsson recommended bifocals for my wife--strange, since she really only needs glasses to read at night-- and we priced replacing lenses for her current frames. This is where we started to get mad. Carlsson Eye Center wanted to charge us in excess of $500--just to replace lenses! This seemed exorbitant to  us, so we called our old optometrist in another state. By comparison, they charge $50 per lens for bifocals. Needless to say, we opted not to purchase from Carlsson. \\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s more, my wife has MS, but has never had an issue with her vision. That being said, we routinely disclose her illness so that it can go into her records. Dr. Carlsson asked to dilate her eyes to perform a more throrough exam. Not a problem, but he wanted to bill as a \\\\\"medical\\\\\" expense. This would have run us another $300 or so out of pocket, since Carlsson is not a participating provider on our medical. Of course, the real problem here is that we\\'ve NEVER paid a \\\\\"medical\\\\\" fee to have our eyes dilated. Again, I thought this was a routine service on most eye exams.\\\\n\\\\nThat leaves the matter of my contacts. Despite the fact that I\\'m an experienced contact lens wearer, I had to see Dr. Carlsson four times. He gave me four different sets of contacts, none of which worked for me. The problems ranges from poor depth perception, to discomfort, to imjust plain couldn\\'t see. On one set, i couldn\\'t even identify dreeway signs. Prerty vad considering my current lenses get me pretty close to 20/20, but aren\\'t great for closeup work. I finally asked my old doctor for my prescription from last year, as at least I can see reasonably well with my old contacts. At that point dr. Carlsson wrote me a script for my old contacts--although he told me that they were only 2 week wear lenses. Subsequent investigation revealed that they are indeed monthly wear lenses. Grrrrrr!\\\\n\\\\nThe kicker, though was when I went to purchase my contacts. Having never paid more than about $60 for a six month supply, I was absolutely shocked when the office quoted me $160 for a six-month supply. A quick call to my old doctor proved it--they\\'d send me the same prescription for $88 , including shipping. The next day, I went into Costco and found it for $55. Now, I don\\'t expect that a small operation would be able to match Costco prices, but more than triple the price is a little outrageous. \\\\n\\\\nTo his credit, Dr. Carlsson did give me an extra set of lenses for my trouble. He does seem knowledgeable and caring. But just be prepared to pay quite a lot for his services. To me, it\\'s not worth triple the price for the same services and products.'},\n",

Well, I was very disapointed. Granted they press the tortillas there and fry it up in front of you, mine was not very fried. I worked at restaurants and cooked quesadillas on \\\\\"mexi night\\\\\" and mine were always crispy and hot. This one was merely warmed up and retained little heat during the 1 mile drive home. While the quesadilla wasn\\'t much better than taco bells version, the chips and queso and guacamole were excellent. Very good guac!! It was rich and chunky unlike canned stuff. Maybe I\\'ll just stick to burritos if I go there cause the steak was tasty. \\\\n5/10 only because of the guac, 3/10 without it.\\\\n\\\\nPrice - $5 for that undercooked quesadilla is a sham. $3 tops. The chips and queso were also a bit pricey at $3. I spent $8.50 on the quesadilla, chips, queso and guacamole. I felt like it was a $5 meal in the end.\\\\n3/10\\\\n\\\\nExperience/Vibe - Very plain much like other tex mex joints like Qdoba and Chipotle, only a little worse. The dining setup is awkward and weirdly lit. \\\\n5/10\\\\n\\\\nOverall - 19/40. \\\\n\\\\nWhen the sides impress me more than the main dish I can only give two stars tops. Im sure it would be closer to 3 if I ordered the burrito since thats just easier than a quesadilla but I don\\'t really like burritos that much, so guys lets work on that tortilla frying and better portions!'},\n",

It was such a disappointment after paying thousands of dollars for the flight and hotel ( where at the check in they accepted same passport with no problem). \\\\nWhen we tried to resolve this Security employee treated us the way that no one deserves to be treated. Throwing our document... I have never had this kind of attitude in my life anywhere in The world.\\\\nIf there is a way to submit negative review- this is for this hotel.'},\n",

Unfortunately, my mom needed her prescriptions right away.\\\\n\\\\nI drop off the prescriptions for my mom. The guy said it would take about 30-35 minutes. Okay cool! Since my mom had to take food with her medication, we decided to stay close by and order some food to go. We got back to CVS after about 45 minutes. It turns out that they haven't even started the prescription. They were extremely backed up and it would take 2 hours!! UMMM WHAT?! NO. I was quoted 30-35 minutes and the guy who was helping me earlier was no longer there. Then they told me it would be ready for me in 1 hour. Apparently, they couldn't do anything better than that. I don't understand why they couldn't fill it right then and there. \\\\nIf they had originally quoted me 2 hours, I wouldn't have made it a big deal. It's understandable that they are backed up and I would've gone home and went back. \\\\n\\\\nOh the nightmare doesn't end there. When I go back to the pharmacy, it turns out that the insurance they had on file was expired. So the lady is trying to update it and whatnot. My mom's insurance company's system was down for a routine update. Now I can't pick up the prescriptions until the morning!! I understand that they have no control of that but WHY didn't someone check the insurance when I dropped off the prescription and when I tried to pick it up the first time??

It is a \\\\\"chew\\\\\" toy - made for chewers and designed to be chewed called the Multi Texture Chew Ring by Petstages.  Unfortunately, within mere minutes, my puppy chewed apart all 4 of the rubber balls attached to the rope, and pulled the rope to shreds in one part of the rope ring.  I was shocked that he did that so quickly.  Most of his toys last at least a couple weeks, some much longer, and he chews them all.  \\\\n\\\\nI brought the chewed up bits and the rope ring, along with my receipt, back to Petco later that same afternoon.  The clerk would not get a manager because supposedly she was \\\\\"on break.\\\\\"  The clerk told me that there was nothing that Petco would do as far as exchange it, because nothing was wrong with the toy - it was \\\\\"my dog\\'s fault for chewing it so quickly.\\\\\"  Another clerk showed up to the register and agreed with the first clerk.  I explained that I understood my dog chewed it up - I did not deny that - but to chew it to pieces within minutes is not my dog\\'s fault - the \\\\\"chew\\\\\" toy is obviously not durable.  They refused to do anything at all for me even though I shop there often, I live within a couple miles of the store, and I am a pet lover and would end up buying much more than that $12 chew toy over the years to come.  I explained that PetSmart has told me that if a dog chews apart a toy immediately, to bring it back for a full refund so I thought Petco would have the same policy.  Neither clerk bothered to contact the manager or to exchange it.  \\\\n\\\\nAn 11 month old puppy has many years of food, grooming, toys, clothes, leashes, and accessories to acquire and I will not be purchasing any of them at Petco ever again.

At 12:01, they turned on all the lights, started sweeping up, and pretty much shoo\\'d us out of there. Granted, it was the night before Thanksgiving, but there were a fair number of people there and they pretty much kicked us out on the curb.

But when you\\'re throwing down $6 or $8 for a beer, I for one would like something a little less greasy and a little more complex then fries and whatnot.\\\\n\\\\nI get the feeling they\\'re stuck between being a campy dive bar, like lots of others in Pittsburgh, and a legit beer-drinkers bar like in other big cities.

One big note to good service: don\\'t be strung out when working. Our server looked like she was going to dope nod at any minute at the table. She took her merry time getting drinks (15 minutes for 2 drafts) she checked in in us maybe once. The only upside was that the food came out quickly. \\\\n\\\\nThe downside to food coming out quickly is that it was all reheated from a bag. I got the sampler platter figuring I could try a large variety of offerings. Big mistake. I should have gotten one crap meal instead about six. The chicken was dry and tough. The tamale corn was soggy and gritty. The tortillas were crap. The ground beef looked like Taco Bell beef. All of it was covered in a plasticky sauce that tasted like spicy nothing. The rice was hard. The refried beans were processes and pur\\\\u00e9ed to the point where they resembled something to exit a dysentery riddled newborn.  If they charged Taco Bell prices I wouldn\\'t be as upset but this wasn\\'t cheap either. \\\\n\\\\nTo finish up Emiliano\\'s is a stain on the name of Mexico. They know most Americans wouldn\\'t know authentic Mexican cuisine if it walked up and punched them in the face.

That said, it is easily the best food I\\'ve ever eaten inside of a basement. \\\\n\\\\nIf you stick to the normal food here, it\\'s hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day.\\\\n\\\\n There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn\\'t swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg \\\\\"burrito.\\\\\" I don\\'t know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn\\'t anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn\\'t have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy. \\\\n\\\\nFor dinner, it\\'s pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but  there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I\\'ve never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds. \\\\n\\\\nThe pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called \\\\\"Flavorless.\\\\\" That\\'s More\\'s pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels. \\\\n\\\\nThe Chicken - I don\\'t know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of \\\\\"The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin\\\\\" but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be. \\\\n\\\\nSo all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you\\'re spending the full $26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra $14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo\\'s Paradise Buffet for the same price.'},\n",

Drove 5 miles there to find out there is hardly any parking available anywhere and had to park behind a carwash few hundred feet away. After getting inside had to walk to the corner of the very busy bar to pay for the take out. Asked the bartender if that was all the food my wife ordered, she said Yes. Drove back home to find out they completely forgot my daughter's food, called them back and was informed the food was sitting at the bartender's register the whole time! Drove another 5 miles back thinking they would at least comp the forgotten food but they put a $5 coupon for the next time!!! I'm not sure how they have such high rating, the Calzone and Mediterranean salad were tasteless, forgot my daughter's Caprese Salad and by the time I made this 20 mile 2 times round trip, she had already gone to sleep and didn't eat.

       "               'review': 'What can I say about Arlequino\\'s? I\\'m a Montreal ex-pat living in Ottawa, but I always return home for my birthday to celebrate with friends from Montreal. From a distance, and through some searching I came upon this lovely sounding restaurant and booked it for my group of 16. Unfortunately this turned out to be a mistake of epic proportions. Let\\'s follow the night in order of events.\\\\n\\\\nDrink orders:\\\\nOne of my friends suggested we split a bottle of wine, a suggestion I liked, but neither of us are really wine connoisseurs. We asked the waitress for some suggestions, letting her know that we both preferred sweeter white wines, but she didn\\'t know anything about the wine menu, \\\\\"I don\\'t really drink wine\\\\\" was her response. We asked her if anyone there knew, and she just shrugged. Not particularly helpful.\\\\n\\\\nAppetizers:\\\\nOn reading some reviews a friend and I decided to try the calamari, they serve it here in long strips and it was fried up nicely, but there was very little flavouring to it without any dipping sauce. The sauce they served it with seemed to be some sort of mayo-based sauce but I didn\\'t really know what it was, and it didn\\'t taste very good. Another of my friends ordered the fried bocconcini, it sounded nice but for $7 it came with 2 pieces, which is a little disappointing. The ceasar salad I ordered was tasty if a bit too salty.\\\\n\\\\nPizza:\\\\nWhile I won\\'t comment second hand on everyone else\\'s pizza experience, I will talk about the one I tried. I ordered the Pescara, which sounded very nice as: tomato sauce, cheese, pancetta and hot peppers. First this is not the wood burning pizza you would expect. As reviewer Dave I. suggests this is not authentic wood burning pizza. The top had burnt crusts yet the cheese was completely evenly cooked and well spaced out and the bottom was soggy, and not crispy at all. The worst of it was the over-abundant use of hot peppers on this particular variation; the rest of the ingredients couldn\\'t be tasted with the amount of hot peppers they used, it was just completely unbalanced. I would have tasted the same flavours had I just eaten some soggy dough and a jar of hot peppers.\\\\n\\\\nDessert:\\\\nHere\\'s where my biggest issue of the night started. When I called to book they had asked if I wanted a birthday cake. I thought \\\\\"why not?\\\\\" and chose a cake. Now it\\'s certainly my fault at this point for not asking the cost of this added service, but for they price they charged they could have mentioned it. This restaurant claimed to have made the cake in house and charged $5 per person for the cake (a total of $75). Now I know this is how some higher end restaurants work, and while I wouldn\\'t call Arlequino\\'s higher end, it\\'s their right to choose this business model. My issue of contention is not the actual cost of the cake but the reaction of the owner of the restaurant when I spoke to him about this issue. I calmly and politely told him that if they were going to charge such an exorbitant amount for a tiny cake, the least they could do is tell people the cost up front without having to be asked. Had I known, I would have brought my own cake. His response was: \\\\\"We\\'d have charged you $3 per person if you brought your own. What can I tell you? It\\'s business.\\\\\" For me this was an inadequate response to a customer concern. I\\'m not saying I expected him to reimburse me for the cake; I didn\\'t expect any sort of gratuity, but the man didn\\'t even have the decency to apologize or attempt to appease me in any sort of way. This is no way to manage any sort of service industry business, let alone a restaurant. His response was equally cold and careless to one of my friends who tried to speak to him about the same issue. \\\\n\\\\nThat final experience of the night led me to understand Arlequino\\'s for what it is. This is an upscale, supposedly hip pizzeria. The decor and ambience are fantastic, but their downfall is that they are far more invested in the look than the quality of food or their customers\\' satisfaction. I certainly imagine that the owner will begin to care more about his customers when they stop coming to eat at this restaurant.'},\n",

I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  \\\\n\\\\nThe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.\\\\n\\\\nOur server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live.\"},\n",

This was about 6 years ago.  Then we visited again about 2 years ago and had a mediocre experience.\\\\n\\\\nThis past Friday, we were looking for a place to have a romantic dinner and Porta Bella definitely provides an atmosphere and secluded seating which provides this.  From the romantic/private standpoint, we got exactly what we were looking for, a booth for two in a secluded area.\\\\n\\\\nThe food is where I have really struggled over the past two visits.  First off, keeping in mind this is an Italian restaurant, they are very limited in their ability to accommodate any alteration to their meal .  They have a pasta combo, which by default comes with lasagna and chicken tetrazzini.  My wife, not being a fan of cream sauces, asked if she could simply get Spaghetti Bolognese instead of the tetrazzini.  She was told that everything is pre-portioned so that you could not swap.  Ok, whatever...she ordered the Bigoli Bolognese.  Because she\\'s pregnant, she can\\'t eat cold cut meats and asked if they could \\\\\"hold\\\\\" the meat on her salad.  We were again told this was not possible, because the salads are all pre-made.  This seems crazy for an Italian restaurant, to essentially have everything pre-made up.  As if pasta and sauce are hard to prepare.  Clearly they are not doing anything too special in the kitchen to prepare our meals.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end, the quality of the meal spoke to their effort in preparation.  The bolognese sauce was rather flavorless and my seafood tetrazzini was even less flavorful and nearly dry.  At an avg of around $15 per entree, I don\\'t expect 5 star quality, but to be honest I could have gotten a better meal at an Italian chain restaurant and they would have been more accommodating in the meal preparation.\\\\n\\\\nI would recommend looking at many of the other Italian restaurants in Madison.'},\n",

Limited in seating and unpleasant in demeanor it was to the Starbucks next door that I proceeded for my tasting and sampling each item in the warm sun a \\\\\"get what you pay for\\\\\" theme soon emerged, the copyright-infringement skirting crispy fried croissants tasting suspiciously of old oil while cupcakes proved dry and dull beneath competent, mildly sweet frosting - my unconfirmed suspicion that \\\\\"slow sales\\\\\" meant I was purchasing Friday\\'s unlabeled leftovers from people unhappy to be at work on a Saturday.  One of the worst bakeries I\\'ve experienced in Las Vegas or elsewhere I can only assume something has changed dramatically at Caked in recent months as older reports suggest both variety and skill.  Poor in selection and unpleasant in manner there are far better bakeries throughout Las Vegas and having left more than 75% of what I purchased in the Starbucks wastebasket I\\'m rather certain even that overpriced corporate giant proves a better value on the dollar.'},\n",

It was fine but not as special as on previous visits. My favorite seasonal dish is the Chilis en Nogada - a whole chili stuffed with chicken and dried fruits with a creamy almond sauce and fresh pomegranates. In this past, this dish was dreamy! On this night it was a nightmare. Dried out chicken, bland chile, and so sweet it was barely edible. Also, it was served with a side of cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes that added absolutely nothing to the dish.

We were on a weekend trip to watch Spring Training Games in Arizona and this location was very close to the hotel we were staying at.  The restaurant is starting to show its wear and age.  It appears to be an older shop in the chain.  Things started off on the wrong foot with the gentleman that took our order. We asked for our usual order of Lo Mein with Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp and a side order of Pot Stickers.  Our order taker added extra shrimp to our Lo Mein instead of the Kung Pao Shrimp that we had ordered, so we only had one item for a family of four. Once the food came out, it was very evident that the quality was not what we were accustomed to from our usual location.  The beef was a bit fattier, and the overall dish was much greasier than we were accustomed.  The potstickers were seriously over cooked  were dry and had very bad flavor.  We then waited for a while for our Kung Pao that never came.  Once we figured out that there had been a mistake on the order, I went over to the front desk and brought it to their attention.  The manager recognized the mistake and to her credit said that she would handle it.  I offered to pay since I recognize that the order taker may not have heard me since it was very loud in the restaurant.  However the manager made our food and delivered it to us at no additional charge.  That was very good in my book.  The kung pao shrimp was definitely much better than the other two items that we had.

A runny egg, so runny I think the whites were still runny, in a breakfast burrito, is a breeding ground for disease. I mean, cook the friggin' egg.

Are you iactually living in the city or are you trapped on the top floor of Bellevue? There is nothing, absolutely nothing in Phoenix or anywhere else that compares to anything in NYC. One moment in NYC makes you forget the rest of the world exists. I digress, anyway, my third visit was the veggie burrito. Nothing I like better than raw mushrooms stuffed in a burrito. Why did I go back for a fourth visit? I did, I ordered a mushroom soup. I thought they would have to cook the mushrooms in the soup? Who knows, it tasted like water. Dear D'Lish, the way you make mushroom soup is very simple. Start with some shallots, saute them in a stock pot, you can add onions and garlic if you wish. Next add a whole mess of mushrooms, you can just use white ones, or mix them up, cremini, portabella, oyster, just saute them until all the water is removed, then add stock and cook for about 20 minutes - blend soup to a creamy texture, finish with some milk or cream and you have soup. Salt and pepper to taste. So simple, and yet you just couldn't do it.

This is a chain that has a surprisingly loyal following, but I will not be part of that multitude and here is why.\\\\n\\\\nThe interior has no sound abatement, so one cannot hear or understand the waitress.  This morning it was only a third full and I cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered eggs over medium, sausage and potato, along with \\\\\"plain\\\\\" English muffin and juice.  My son ordered scrambled eggs, potato and corned beef hash.  \\\\n\\\\nUpon pretty fast service we were confronted with my fried eggs well-done hard, potato so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot.  Not a lick of salt, onion, oil, parsley or anything other than those miserable potato rectangles.  \\\\n\\\\nSausages were good, flavorful and not greasy.  The \\\\\"plain\\\\\" English muffin came with the oil that they try to pretend is butter.  I handed the muffin to the waitress and reminded her that I wanted \\\\\"plain\\\\\".  She promptly informed me that they had two types of muffin, plain and whole wheat and I ordered plain.\\\\n\\\\nThis is when my son and I exchanged glances and knew, really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets.\\\\n\\\\nIt is like ordering \\\\\"regular\\\\\" coffee in Mass and getting cream and sugar in it.  So be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered.  Seek clarity from you waitress, if you can hear her and if she can her you.  \\\\n\\\\nMy son\\'s corned beef was straight out of the can, it just had been heated and broken apart from the can shape before serving.  \\\\n\\\\nWe both left disappointed.  When the cashier asked \\\\\"how was everything\\\\\" she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a beat in making change along with my silence.  It seemed that Le Peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen.\\\\n\\\\nI did look at the computerized bill and there was no descriptor for how eggs were to be cooked or for the muffin.  They must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress (yes, they were all females) is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crew\\'s judgement.\\\\n\\\\nWith so many restaurants and other forms of eating establishment in Charlotte don\\'t waste your time at this particular Le Peep.

We dined here on 10/11/14.\\\\n\\\\nWe valeted our car.  I wasn't even out of the vehicle before I was greeted by a couple of obnoxious drunk guys spouting off at the mouth.  Badgers won that day-gotsta celebrate I guess.\\\\n\\\\nWhile one of us checked in our party of 12, the rest of us thought we would get a drink at the bar while we waited.  It was a very makeshift bar-the kind you would find at a very makeshift wedding reception with only a handful of different liquors set out on a table with some wine, no tappers, etc. Thankfully they were ready to seat us before we even got to order... so we proceeded to the table.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant was comfortable. High ceilings, warm, soft lighting from the well scaled chandeliers hanging above. Obviously the view of the lake was fantastic as the Autumn sun was setting.  Too bad the open kitchen's bright task light kept trying to creep in and ruin my ambiance.  \\\\n\\\\nSo back to my pre-dinner cocktail....I love a good old fashioned and quite frankly, was scared to order one after seeing that ghetto bar, but it's what I really had a taste for, so I thought I would exercise due diligence and ask some specific Qs, such as, if they muddle their drinks, etc. After about 30 long minutes, our drinks arrived. Well, the muddling turned out fine, but there were only about four ice cubes in the entire glass. One of my dining companions, Rich B. (see his recent review on 10/12) was kind enough to order me a glass of ice to make it right. Thanks, Rich B!  \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the beef heart tartare. Edible, but still some of the worst I've ever had and I pretty much order tartare whenever I see it on a menu.  Chef was a bit heavy-handed on the mustard. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the Filet for my main course-medium rare.  They served it to me somewhere between Medium to medium well. I sent it back and enjoyed the company of my friends while they prepared another for me.  Soon afterward, as my friends were finishing up their meals, the Manager brought me my second steak.  I cut into it to find that it was so rare it was purple.  Mgr said she was hurrying my steak so that I could eat dinner, but I never really ate anything because I obviously sent that one back too. Haste makes waste.   They did ask me if there was ANYTHING on the menu they could get me to right this wrong, but at this point, my friends had finished eating and I had run out of patience, so it's a good thing that bottle of Sauvignon Blanc I ordered went well with my bread and butter dinner. \\\\n\\\\nMy husband had the Seared Diver Scallops with Risotto. He wished there were more than three scallops, but the dish was tasty.  Many of our friends ordered the fish and it was horribly overcooked in every case. \\\\n\\\\nAs a peace offering to one of us in the group when they forgot to bring out their side dish, they offered a different potato type side dish of baby potatoes encrusted (=coated and rolling around in) salt.  //see picture//  This was perhaps the highlight of the evening and gave us all a good chuckle.

It's not often I harshly critique a restaurant, but this restaurant deserves to have its reputation tarnished. We walked in shortly after 5 PM on a Saturday evening and were initially greeted and shown to our booth. I have never before sampled Indian fare (and never will after this experience) so I was extremely excited to try it. I was prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash to have an all-out authentic Indian cuisine experience to try to cap off an early Valentine's Day date, yet we ended up paying $24 for two half-plates of terrible food. After sitting at our booth for ten minutes (the restaurant was NOT crowded) we just assumed it was buffet-styled only and went to each grab a plate. I had no idea what anything was and just tried to sample a small bit of everything. The food was barely warm, wasn't seasoned (isn't Indian food supposed to be spicy?), and there wasn't any naan, which my partner told me was tasty bread. \\\\n\\\\nAfter being grossed out by our food my partner asked if there was a way we could receive menus and order food from them instead. The server proceeded to ignore his inquiry. He discussed just leaving without paying in total disgust for the lack of service and awful food, but we promptly paid and left. For what it's worth we watched as another larger group walked in behind us and were approached at their table and asked if they wanted the buffet or to see a menu. I have half a mind to suspect we were treated so rudely due to our sexual orientation. \\\\n\\\\nIn seeing the reviews below if THIS is what you Pittsburghers consider to be great food then you obviously lack any sense of culinary expertise. I would love to thank India Garden for ruining my first foray into Indian cuisine along with our Valentine's Day.\"},\n",

I have been to some places before where its been pretty dead, and the service is slower than it should be. So the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order. My husband tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty. So I tasted them, and they tasted like they were dipped in salt. There were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato? But I was too afraid to try them to be sure. Then she comes back and takes our order. I got a vegetarian hash with some rye toast. I thought all sandwiches came with a side, but mine didn\\'t. Which is fine, I wasn\\'t that hungry anyway. My husband got a mozzarella, tomato, and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries. My hash was not what I thought it would be. When you think of a hash, you think crispy potatoes, full of veggies, and just really tasty. Mine was none of those things. It was mushy potatoes, and little tiny bits of vegetables. The rye was decent. Nothing special. My husbands sandwich was better than mine. I wish I had gotten something else. The waitress even asked how it was, and I told her it wasn\\'t anything special.\\\\n\\\\nMost of the sandwiches are really overpriced. Most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around $11, which seems really steep for this kind of place. Maybe they have to make up for the fact that they have no business? I don\\'t know.

I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.\\\\n\\\\nNow it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really?

The wait staff seemed very frazzled and overwhelmed for such a small restaurant.  Essentially the staff seemed untrained and unable to handle their small section of tables.  We told them we would like to cancel our order and left to go to another breakfast restaurant.  We never had a chance to try the food so I cannot comment on the quality.  However, the menu was very limited if you do not like waffles.  It also was over priced with most breakfast entrees costing $9-$11 and not having large portions from what we could observe from the few tables who were fortunate enough to have received their food after the very long wait.  Overall, we will never go back to this establishment and we would not recommend it to any friends or family in the future.'},\n",

That is partially true after experiencing it first hand camping out for the Jordan 11 playoffs.  The better way to describe it is.. who ever is the first 5 in line will get a shoe along with all their homies that they let cut.  There is no security guard or employee regulating the line.  Even when people from the back would tell the cutters to get to the back, they come up with some excuse saying that they've been there for a long time already or their spot was being saved.  It is pretty obvious and unfair after you see groups of people jump in front of you after you've been waiting for hours.  \\\\n\\\\nThis shoe store is not your Footlocker, Finish Line, Nike store, or Champs.

It was very well organized and despite not being able to pick up my packet early (I live in Rock Hill, too far to drive to Concord twice) picking it up the day of the race was simple\\\\\\\\easy ($5 charge was a little too capitalistic for my taste but still cheaper than the gas I would have spent driving to packet pick up) The cost to run this 5k is a little pricey considering all you get is a cotton tshirt and a race bib but I didn't feel like it was a rip-off because I did feel like I was on a real life game show and that's not an easy thing to produce. The start music was great and the obstacles are designed to be fun yet some where slightly challenging. The gorilla bars, the get up and over and even getting up most of the slides requires some upper body and leg strength. The moon bounce, foam slide and tarzan swing were more pure entertainment. The wrecking ball, jumpy balls (darn near impossible to do) and sweeper were the only obstacles that had any real element of danger\\\\\\\\failure to them. Cool running's was by far the fan favorite as people kept going back to repeat it (going down a slide on a inner tube)  The tire mile was really pointless afterthought that could be taken out for something the better. The big slide at the end was fun too but by then I was almost tired of the slides. I think they could have taken out the drop and tire mile for the tight rope transverse and the aqua drag (other obstacles they have done in other cities but didn't do in Charlotte as they only pick 12) and that would have added enough variety to keep it from feeling redundant. The end felt sort of anticlimactic as there was no celebration afterwards outside of the foam photo place which was cold and crowded at times. Not much in the way in food or prizes. And for once at the drink stations at the mile markers, can we get some actual COLD water\\\\\\\\sport drinks? Seriously that nasty water out the hose almost made me gag. I'm surprised a drink vendor sponsor wouldn't want to market their product for a bunch of thirsty participants. At the end of the day, people were having a good time. I was running with a group of about 8-9 people and that is the way to go. The more the merrier, get dressed up, act silly, laugh at each other, keeping everybody motivated when you get tired. Don't go out there trying to take yourself serious or be a loner or you will be sorely disappointed. Certainly a race I can recommend for casual runners like me and with just a few more tweaks, it could be the best race hands down every year.\"},\n",

We decided to try the high end of the menu sharing orders of Jhinga Dum Sunerhri (queen prawns simmered in coconut milk, yogurt and a touch of cashew nut sauce) and Goshet Rajawri (boneless lamb cooked in spices, tomatoes, egg, yogurt and a cashew paste).  Entrees included basmati rice, a choice of naan or paratha (we tried both) and lentil side dishes.

Complimentary papadum was served with tamarind and cilantro dipping sauces shortly after we were presented with menus.  The waiter convinced us to try the evening's special appetizer, a crepe made with corn, homemade cheese and potato which proved to be an excellent choice.  Our first entre was Murg chili milli kebab - tandori chicken marinated in Indian spices and accompanied by an East Asian sauce. The chicken was amazingly moist, tender and very flavor-ific.  Our second entre was Baingan dahiwala - roasted eggplant cooked with yogurt and onions in a cashew sauce.  This dish was not as smooth textured as similar dishes served elsewhere, but was very tasty.   Menu prices may initially seem high, but most entrees include a side salad, choice of naan or paratha, basmati rice and a lentil dipping sauce - we chose black. Everything was fantastic while service was very attentive without be intrusive.\\\\n\\\\n12/07 update to include 3 additional visits\\\\n\\\\nWe were served housemade papadum with mint and tamarind sauces followed by a complimentary sweet potato salad that managed to be both spicy and cooling.  My wife ordered the lamb chop masala - small tender chops that had been cooked in masala sauce.  My entre was chicken makhani, aka butter chicken, - melt-in-your mouth pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.  Both entrees included basmati rice, a black lentil dipping sauce, naan and an unadorned salad.

We each ordered chicken kebab roll - grilled tandoor chicken wrapped in a Romali roll.  Lunches include a choice of ice tea or soda, we chose the ice tea.  The flavor was truly amazing, but the amount of food was more than we needed.  The cost of the meal is net of a $10 coupon received after I provided online feedback on our experience in September.  \\\\n\\\\nWe were served complimentary papadum with mint and tamarind sauces. Orders of chicken Chettinad - boneless thigh pieces cooked with pounded southern spices with a hint of coconut and lamb Rajwari - boneless lamb cooked with spices, tomatoes, yogurt and a touch of cashew.

The menu here offers a huge variety. I ventured away from my usual favorite entr\\\\u00e9es (Meat loaf, asian or one of the pasta dishes) and tried the jambalaya pasta. The flavor was delicious but the chicken was dry,  as was the entire dish. It was probably overcooked. The flavor was so good that I may try it again after getting the waiter's opinion about the norm for this dish.  About the waiter,  he did a great job despite a very busy night. We spent $80 for 2, with alcohol. Norm is more like $20-$25 ea. Recommended\"},\n",

On top of that...the price includes unlimited wine and beer.  They had coors and PBR on tap and a few wines.  \\\\n\\\\nAs for the food....I wouldn't say that it is the best buffet in vegas, but you have a lot to choose from.  As with all buffets...avoid sushi if you can.  Many of the hand-carved meats are on the dry side.  But they offered crawfish, fried shrimp, paella, creamed spinach, rice, salads, and pretty solid fish here too.  I loved their shrimp dishes and their pork offerings.   \\\\n\\\\nThere are a lot of misses, but they have enough hits to make this a great outing.   Particularly if you come with the intent on drinking a lot of beer.  If you don't like alcohol, I recommend that you hit up their root beer on tap.   It's pretty good.  \\\\n\\\\nOverall...the reason I'd come back is because they have enough good entrees that you will go home full and happy.   More importantly, they have an awesome price point and unlimited beer.  \\\\n\\\\nThe cons are that not all of the food is great and that it's located 10 miles off the strip.  \\\\n\\\\nMy favorite buffet in Vegas is the wicked spoon because of their willingness to offer creative entrees that you'd normally see in nice restaurants.  Second would be Bellagio because of its standout desserts and great entrees.   I'd rate this as a viable contender for third best buffet in Vegas.  Check it out as you leave the strip.\"},\n",

When I saw my Braves were going to be here in August, my brother and I planned a day trip down from Western NY. We were both very impressed with PNC Park and the surrounding area. \\\\n\\\\nWe waited next to the right field gate before we could get in. There was a little fence with a concrete bench attachment across the access road we could sit in and enjoy the shade. Only waited about 3-4 minutes in line once the gates opened. They check bags, but you can bring one that is 16x16x8 in and you can bring up to a 24 oz disposable water bottle in for each person. Could get in 1.5 hours before and the Braves were about halfway through batting practice when we got there so we went to our seats to watch. \\\\n\\\\nI picked up tickets (dugout box) at box office price on StubHub in March, but people around us said they got tickets right from the Pirates website this week there too. The seats were very nice. Patted bottoms, wide enough that you weren't totally squished. I was lucky and no one sat the in the two seats next to me even. There was a nice attendant for the section that cleaned off the seats and welcomed us in. He did a good job making sure kids got foul/extra balls and getting autograph hawks out of the way before the game. Though I would have liked to see the whole park enforce not having people go to their seats during game play. \\\\n\\\\nI walked around some and they had many different choices for food but the lines were pretty long about 30-45 minutes before the game. Prices were typical for a ball park, though I think $4 for a bottle of water and $5 for a 20oz bottle of pop are excessive. $9 for a higher end milkshake, $5-9 for Dippin Dots, etc.  I was full from the early dinner we ate so I had a Lemon Chill cup. It was like 16oz and only $5.50, so I enjoyed it for like half of the game and it hit the spot. My brother got Nachos later with two cups of the cheese, jalapenos, and onions on it and an Iron City Beer. \\\\n\\\\nWe parked at the W. General Robinson garage across the street and it was an easy in and out to get back on 279-N HOV lane and get out of downtown. \\\\n\\\\nI'd definitely look to come back to Pittsburgh and catch more games in the future.\"},\n",

You are going to have to wait in line and it is going to be crazy inside the bakery, as every bakery should be.  Get over it.  This is a real New York style bakery (which I have seldom found outside of New York no matter what the sign says).  New York baked goods are less sweet than out here and the flavors are more subtle. . . the way it should be.  Everything I had was SPOT ON as far as flavor and presentation goes.  On a scale of 1-10, cheese cake was a 9.  Crumb cake was a 10.  Canaille was a 10 (was pre filled which was a little disappointing but still nice and crispy.  Brownie with nuts was an 8.  Both the carrot and red velvet cupcakes were a 10.  I am a baker and very hard to please.   I say go, wait in the line and enjoy some baked goods the way they were meant to taste.\"},\n",

The veggies tasted fresh sliced, the bacon was crispy, and there were big chunks of chicken.  It was one of the best pizzas I've had.  Not super cheap for a pizza at about $18 but so, so good.\\\\n\\\\nSo some of the best pizzas are the specialty ones on the menu, and not just the ready-made ones under the heat lamps.  \\\\n\\\\nSo now I say: 5 stars for the pizza, 3 for the empanadas.\\\\n\\\\nThe pizza is - for my money - the best of its kind on campus, and certainly the best within an easy walk from the quad.  The prices per slice seemed a little high until I went to Sbarro and got a much more disappointing slice for more money.  I won't do that again.\\\\n\\\\nHere they usually have the traditional pizzas - cheese, sausage, pepperoni - but the standouts are their more unusual toppings.  My other favorite is the hungry goat, which has tomato, basil, mushrooms, and goat cheese.  A little bit of hot sauce from the counter and you have the perfect greasy mid-day snack.  There are other interesting options that seem to rotate - a potato pizza, a mushroom pizza, a Mexican themed pizza, and the supreme are the ones I remember from last time.  I've also seen apple butter pizza and the barbecue meats, which is good stuff.\\\\n\\\\nThe pizza slices are about 10 inches long and 4.5 wide.  It's a more floppy, chewy pizza.  The cheeses and toppings vary, and it's usually a little greasy - though of course, it depends on what type you get.  When you order it goes in the oven to warm up.\\\\n\\\\nThe empanadas are okay but leave me more hungry than the pizza.  I am not that great a fan of empanadas, though.  I didn't notice a huge difference between the different fillings.  I haven't tried the dessert ones, but I am told they are good.\\\\n\\\\nConvenient and consistently pretty good.\"},\n",

Looking over the menu, I was so happy to see that they offered my favorite, the Lion Roll, which I've only found at one other sushi place in Henderson.  It turns out that the chefs at Jjanga (not that game Jenga) used to work at that Hendo joint, so now I don't have to go all that way to get my fix.  This place is new and was not that busy, which was just fine with us on this Hallmark holiday-no waiting for a table.  Very nice modern decor with wood accenting and quite roomy, this place doesn't feel like your traditional sushi restaurant.  Jung, our waiter du jour, was very friendly and attentive, making sure he answered any questions we had and kept the food and drinks coming.\\\\nIn addition to the Lion Roll, I liked the pumpkin soup, the Johnny Roll, and dessert, of course. Jjanga had a  Valentine's Day special: fried banana with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce, a sweet ending to a great V Day meal. Jung even took our  picture with some new-fangled Polaroid type camera so they could hang our photo on one of the walls, posted with those of other customers. We got one to keep, as well. After such an enjoyable and filling meal, we know that we shall return.\"},\n",

Prior to actually eating here, I had visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for just drinks. The drinks were made well and the prices seemed fair. They have a pretty good selection of wines bottled & on tap. The beers average about $6 but you can get a pitcher for about $12. It\\'s a great deal and even better if you go during happy hour. The bar has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are all very friendly. After a few fun experiences of just hanging out at the bar, I finally actual got a chance to eat here this weekend! It was AMAZING! \\\\n\\\\nFirst we started with their soup of the day, Black Bean Sirloin Chili. We ordered a side of bread to go with it so we could all share it as an appetizer.. It was the perfect way to start our meal. Lots of flavor and they don\\'t skimp on the sirloin portions. For dinner I had the Vegetable Platter, my husband had the Half Chicken, my mom had the BBQ Brisket, and my dad had the Short Ribs. The Vegetable platter was shockingly very filling and had tons of flavor. I was afraid I would miss eating meat for dinner, but I ended up not missing it at all. It was perfect! The kale had a great garlicky flavor and the tomatoes and blue cheese mix is now one of my favorite flavor combinations that I\\'m definitely going to try to mimic at home. I got to taste a bite of all the dishes my family ordered too had they were all great. The chicken was super moist and had a slight sweetness in flavor. The ribs & brisket were both tender and booming with flavor as well. \\\\n\\\\nWhere this restaurants loses a star is because of the sides. Aside from my vegetable platter, All the other side dishes were really lacking in flavor and added nothing the main course. The grits seemed a little mushy and didn\\'t have the flavor your would expect from the Jalepeno. The orzo was just average too. In fact, everyone cleaned their plates of the meats but no one really touched their sides. They kept eating the kale and tomatoes off my plate. The next time I go, I might ask if I can get the kale with my main course instead of the grits or orzo.\\\\n\\\\nOverall I loved it here. I can\\'t wait for a chance to go back and so excited to have a new place in the neighbor I can stumble home from.'},\n",

It is right on the way home and cheaper than some of the other dry cleaners in my area. Wednesday I dropped off some clothes for pick up Wednesday - including my attire for the Yelp Event @ Switch, so I needed to get them. I was nervous when the lady told me that I had a gift certificate for some reason. With dry cleaners that typically means something was damaged and here is a small token of empathy. She said she wasn't sure what the gift certificate was for...nervously I looked over the items and no notes about damaged articles...no missing pieces. I took the $10 certificate and went home.\\\\n\\\\nSoon after I arrived home I noticed I missed a phone call. It was the manager of the cleaners calling to explain the gift certificate. Nothing was wrong with the service. He stated that a few of my shirts were 100% cotton and he did dry clean them as requested; however, those shirts would be better laundered with a bit of starch. The gift certificate was for me to come back and have those shirts laundered on the store's dime. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, he didn't have to give a gift certificate - he completed the order as requested. Secondly, he didn't have to take the time to call and explain the certificate and the reasons behind it.  I will gladly accept this paper gift certificate in the amount of $10 and return future business to this location!\\\\n\\\\nThat is customer service, and it is rare today.\"},\n",

Before, when it was still called 'Ra' it was crowded, it was fun, and there was always someone new to meet. \\\\n\\\\nMy girls and I unknowingly planned our trip to Las Vegas for Memorial Day weekend. I say unknowingly because I know better than to go to Las Vegas during a holiday weekend. Too many people (I just don't do big crowds), too many drunks, and clubs become too expensive. However, it wasn't my birthday and that weekend worked so we went. \\\\n\\\\nWe hit LAX the last night of our stay in Vegas (Sunday night). We got scammed by some dude selling club passes on the strip (in front of Caesar's, don't give him your money) so we knew it would a rough night of clubbing ahead of us. We decided to just go for it and headed to the Luxor. We weren't on a list, we didn't have passes, we were doing it 'the regular way' which I haven't done since I first started clubbing (about 10 years ago). We expected the cover to be insane, especially when we discovered that Ginuwine was performing (don't judge me, I still love Ginuwine). We were told that the cover was $20, but we could expect to pay more by the time we got to the door. Totally understandable, this is Vegas, the goal is to make money.\\\\n\\\\nWe got to the door in record time (less than an hour of waiting in line, score!), and we only paid $30 to get in. I look at this as a bargain because it was a holiday weekend, other clubs were charging much more and there was a performance that night.\\\\n\\\\nThe only real problem we had was that the club was so packed. It was really hard to finish my drink without spilling it on myself (thanks to the thousands of people milling back and forth bumping in to me). After Ginuwine performed a lot of people left so it was easier to dance. Easier, not easy. It was still super packed, no real dancing could be done and getting off the dance floor was very tricky.\\\\n\\\\nOver all, we had a great time; the Luxor never disappoints me. It's always an adventure when we roll through the Luxor.\"},\n",

Unique but very good this way.  The crab was fresh and the cakes were lightly pan fried to perfection.\\\\n\\\\nSalad, Wedge- We shared this, that's how big it was.   The homemade blue cheese dressing was killer!\\\\n\\\\nEntree (1), Porcini Crusted Rib Eye-  First of all, this thing was HUGE (20 oz).  It was just enough sweet, peppery, and very tender.   Served with a side of fresh green beans and huge steak fries (fresh cut).\\\\n\\\\nEntree (2), Filet Mignon- Very nice cut of meat; tender and flavorful with a delicious wine sauce. Fresh green beans and yummy fresh made mashed potatoes served on the side. \\\\n\\\\nDessert, Extra large Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie- Deliciously warm and moist.   We paired it with some espresso and house coffee. \\\\n\\\\nI highly recommend the Triple George.

Matinees are $4.50 and Evening shows are $6.50. People prefer the other newer theaters but your paying a whole lot more. The one thing thats a bummer is that they are finally banning people brining in their own food and snacks. Back when I was working there until a year ago, they finally started cracking down. Thats what was great and seperated this theater from all the others. This place has 12 theaters. Its called Cinedome but only 2 theaters are actually domed lol. They upgraded the seating and painted some vibrant colors inside is about the only difference they have done since it opened during the mid 90's. It is outdated but they run first run movies and actually have a couple 3D screens as well. The snack bar is clean and they actually still have a bulk candy bin. I say if you want to watch first run movies at a great price and not as packed as the big places, this is the place. Until next time!!!\"},\n",

The skills that go into each item is apparent in the fact that they put in quite a bit of alcohol in each (about three shots of liquor per average sized drink) and somehow they play in the taste of the alcohol and turn it into an actual flavor you enjoy. Note, the alcohol flavor isn\\'t masked, only mused with in a way that benefits the overall palate. \\\\n\\\\nIf it\\'s your first time there, try the \\\\\"Sexual Chocolate.\\\\\" Thank me later :)'},\n",

Amazing!\\\\nWe ordered 4 sides\\\\nThe creamed corn, my husband said it was his favorite. It was a little more like a souffl\\\\u00e9 in my opinion. Good taste, sweet but a little fluffy, not like southern creamed corn.\\\\nMashed potatoes- Creamy and delicious.\\\\nMacaroni and cheese- Flavorful.\\\\nBroccolini- tasty.\\\\nThe other dessert we had was the pana cotta. Hmmm, not great, sadly. \\\\n\\\\nThe sides were good. Not to die for but yummy. Usually the sides have me oohing and awing. The main courses were very yummy. \\\\nThis was probably my 2nd time here in Vegas and we probably dine at the LA location yearly. So I'm sure we will be back. \\\\nIt's a great restaurant for special occasions.

Portioned out just right. Prepared foods are delicious and ready to take home, heat, and eat.\\\\n\\\\nThe produce, for the most part, comes in convenient bags, so when you go home, you don't have a fridge full of wasted food.

Also, if you like cheese, they have a fantastic selection of cheddars, bries, and such. \\\\n\\\\nThe other day, I picked up an English Cheddar made with carmelized onion marmalade. It paired well with a hoppy IPA (Hop Ottin IPA was my choice). \\\\n\\\\nThe prepared foods section: Some of the items are healthier than others, but if you use your good judgement, you'll be fine. The caprese pasta is a hit. Also, the buffalo chicken salad pasta is sure to turn you on.\\\\n\\\\nMy favorite part of this store is the fresh chicken and turkey! Everything is fresh, and has a nice healthy color to it, unlike what I've seen at Sunflower and Sprouts. Occasionally Trader Joe's is guilty of this too.\\\\n\\\\nAnother big plus to this store, is the self checkout lanes. You don't need to deal with store employees, but the few that are in the store are very friendly and helpful.\\\\n\\\\nOften times, they are just there to help bag your groceries.\"},\n",

I looked at a few of the behind the scene videos just to get a background of the show and Dancers.  It helped.  Check out the videos on Cirque\\'s Youtube page.\\\\n\\\\nIf you love seeing people dance, this is the show for you.  Im not into the dance shows on tv, but damn, I can sure appreciate some talent when I see it.  I think damn near everyone on the stage could moonwalk.  There are a lot of acrobatic parts to the show as well.  \\\\n\\\\nMy favorite part of the show was not the MJ Hologram (which was badass, I must say).  I\\'ll just say, wait for the part with the\\\\\" Lights that outline the dancers Suits\\\\\"  That part alone was worth the price of admission.  I don\\'t know how anyone can coordinate something like that.  EPIC..... \\\\n\\\\nFor some reason, I expected to see a MJ lookalike throughout the whole show, which initially, I was slightly disappointed.   That made the MJ Hologram that much more awesome.  I get the chills just watching that part of it.   At that moment, I envisioned what it would of been like to see him LIVE.  \\\\n\\\\nJade Xu has some serious skills with that BO.  The twins from Chile got some serious dance skills.  There was one black guy who was dressed different from everyone else.  I\\'ve never seen anyone dance like him.  It looked like he was just hovering from one end of the stage to the other.  Just gliding on his tippy toes.  Salute to you amigo.  \\\\n\\\\nAs for the seating area.  I sat in row 19 of section 102.  It was the last row.  Great seats right in the middle.  I\\'d suggest getting seats towards the back of 102 or the First row of sections 202, 203 or 204.  The show is all around you.  The dancers at times pass behind me and dance along the walkways.  I had people dangling right above my head.  Their is action going on to the far right and far left of the stage.  Even at the beginning of the show, the 4 teenagers that star in the show are mingling with people in the seats.

They all sported vans, skinny jeans, t-shirts and a zip up sweat shirts.  The industrial like environment made conversations bounce off walls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.  But, it was clean and service was FAST!\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the breakfast special.  Our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toast and apple smoked sausage.  Wow, was he correct.  The french toast was incredible.  The sausage was good.  I normally do not eat pork products anymore, so my rating of \\\\\"good\\\\\"; I am sure does not do it justice.\\\\n\\\\nMy husband does not eat pork products, so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage, turkey bacon or Soy; they did not have any.  So, his breakfast choice immediately became limited.  He ordered the cheese omelet.  It was filled with mushrooms, and red peppers.  Potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his dish.\\\\n\\\\nThe coffee was not bad; but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.  So, we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed Starbucks coffee.\\\\n\\\\nWe enjoyed our experience.  If we lived in Phoenix, I am sure we\\'d eat there again.

She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that! Generous servings of sausage, chicken and shrimp are provided. \\\\n\\\\nMISC\\\\nThe bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone.

I was in awe.\\\\n\\\\nThis club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.\\\\n\\\\nIf you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.\\\\n\\\\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor. And when it gets crowded, the walk ways are almost impossible to go through without squeezing past one another.\\\\n\\\\nOther than those, I'll definitely be going back to this place when I get the chance especially to see Kaskade since he's made his home here for the next year!

Nothing was looking too promising since most the places I saw were repeats from Town Square (yawn).  Out of nowhere I see a sign for a place called Poppy Den.  What's a Poppy Den and who is Angelo Sosa? I don't know the answers to either of those questions but remembered seeing a bunch of people on Yelp, who are far more into food than I, raving about the place.  And here it was, standing before me.\\\\n\\\\nI was greeted by two pleasant young ladies at the front desk and was quickly seated out on the patio. What's this?!?  A patio dining space in Vegas that doesn't look out onto a parking lot!  I'm sold already.\\\\n\\\\nTruthful statement in 1...2...3...The menu was a bit, well, unfamiliar to me ingredient-wise.  Some of the items I've never had before and the ingredients were foreign to me.  But that's what this is all about; trying something new.  I ordered a glass of cabernet while checking out the menu further. It was their house cab and tasted quite nice however I'd prefer a cab to be served in the proper wine glass, not a one size fits all wine glass.  I chose the Kim Chi fried rice for an appetizer/side dish.  Now I don't know who this Kim lady is but I'm in love with her fried rice. The presentation was cool since it had a whole sunny-side-up egg laid on top...different is good; I like that.  That stuff was amazing; I'll return just because of the fried rice.  For my entree I chose the steak and potatoes, with the steak medium plus. To my surprise the steak was cooked to the proper temperature (something a lot of places have a hard time doing) and was seasoned quite good. The potatoes, while odd in shape, were very good as well.  For desert, well, not really a fan of the strawberry shortcake.  The ice cream portion was great but the cracked pepper whipped cream was a shock to the taste buds; not for me.  The cake portion was kind of odd...not spongey, not flakey, not dense, not moist; something was just off about it and I can't put my finger on it.  The consistency was not to my liking.\\\\n\\\\nI really dig the atmosphere of the restaurant inside and out.  And let's be real here for a minute, the couple short comings in the meal were made up by the outstanding service provided by Eddie; who evidently is from Texas but not a country boy. Whatever man...I enjoyed dining here because of you and will be requesting you next time around.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for providing a unique experience in the oftentimes tiring dining experience that occurs in Las Vegas.  I'm taking off one star solely based on a few menu selections not agreeing with my admittedly inexperienced pallet and the fact that I truly feel that wine should be presented in the proper glassware.

The ambiance was really serene and the people who worked there were very helpful. The place was clean and quiet.

We took 5 min to go over any health issues and she asked me if I have any specific areas that needed specific attention. The massage was so soothing with good pressure. She was very professional and never spoke during the session, which is what I like. There is a small lounge where you can gather yourself after the massage to recompose- you know, grogginess post massage, and have tea or something to drink.

We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.\\\\n\\\\nFor a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.

The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers.

Husband and I ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte. As we waited for our food, we watched the burrito go by and decided we'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split. My latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top, delivered by a smiling employee. First sip - heavenly. (One of the better lattes I've had recently and I'm a coffee snob.) Quickly our crepes followed, looking beautiful on pristine, white plates. There were strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy, but definitely filling. Husband requested caramel be drizzled over his, adding a sweeter taste to his crepe. Crepe was light and airy, no crispy edges and just sweet enough. The cream and berries were definitely fresh.\\\\n\\\\nThe location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic.

Based upon my first experience, this place has potential - unlike the band I listened too.. but they at least had some passion.. no, that's not the word.. delusion, but enough about them. \\\\n\\\\nI paid a cover to see a few bands, out of none I have ever heard of.. and most likely never will. I sat down at the bar and the girl behind the bar lip read my order (due to the high volume), and she did it flawlessly. I was very impressed. \\\\n\\\\nThe place itself is nice enough, and I am a big fan of the fact that you can sit outside on the other side of the bar. When it comes to the clientele there is a clash, because the establishment does not attract the real metal fans out there, but instead a glam-version of such. The people that want the grit of the image but still enjoy a decent cocktail. I have a hard time wrapping my head around it, and yet it does amuse me. \\\\n\\\\nOverall I will give this place another shot, because it has great potential.. and since I imagine the clientele and atmosphere changes with the band, I might have just caught a slow night. \\\\n\\\\n*** For you metalheads out there. This establishment does not cater to the metalhead, it caters to the occasional metal listener. This is not a posh version of a true rock bar, this is a fictitious Hollywood-up version of such establishment. For better or worse. ***\"},\n",

I first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known, but they\\'ve always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.  I was here yesterday with a larger group of friends and we had a blast.  We didn\\'t have a reservation and there was about 8 of us, so the wait was about 45 minutes.  Great excuse to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.  We ordered some fries with bacon and cheese and also some fried mushrooms as appetizers, greasy goodness!!  The server was really good, she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different delicious beers.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and then had a beer with us after her shift was over.  The wings are a must have when you visit.  My favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wings which are delicious.  They are baked and then grilled, so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you... relatively...  The garlic parm wings are also great and I suggest you definitely try these as well.  I also ordered the steak and egg \\\\\"headwich\\\\\" which is  definitely as big as my head.  It was enough for three of us to share along with the wings.  And, to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers, wings, steaks, and eggs weren\\'t enough we also tried one of the desserts (cheesecake) which was a little better than average.  Overall, this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh\\'.  It\\'s a must visit when you are in the city.'},\n",

It had been packed the previous weekend, with a front window that opens up onto the great terrasse on Avenue Mont-Royal.  Terrasse was unfortunately closed on this particular night as the permit was in transition, so we sat inside.\\\\n\\\\nOur fab serveuse, Emilie, was very quick to serve us and knowledgeable on the beers on tap.  Saint-Sacrament has house blonde and rousse brews, the former of which isn\\'t stupendous in terms of taste but is rather good, and one could imagine sinking quite a few over the course of a Saturday night.  Other beers on tap include Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Alexander Keith\\'s, and a couple others -- nothing out-of-the-ordinary.\\\\n\\\\nThe bar seemed not quite as well-stocked as it could be, but the place does not profess to be a nightclub or cocktail bar, and Emilie was able to improvise where necessary.  It is, quite directly, a tavern.\\\\n\\\\nAmbiance was really where Saint-Sacrament has things kicking on all cylinders.  Amazing long wooden tables made from reclaimed wood are at bar-stool height, and are great for larger groups.  (I anticipate if you show up at a decent hour on a weekend, you won\\'t have to contort to ask for chairs from other tables.)  Fantastic tin ceiling.  There are about four or five individual and properly-interior-designed washrooms in the back.  Place is spotless, and the music is fantastic: good mix of Rolling Stones (\\\\\"Bitch\\\\\"!  Hadn\\'t heard that in years), Johnny Cash, and other proper pub music blasting over a great sound system.  After cranking the music up louder at one point, one of the proprietors actually came over to make sure our table wasn\\'t disturbed by the volume, since we were right under the speaker.  Nice touch there, too.  (Considering the quality of the music we weren\\'t disturbed at all.)  There\\'s at least one TV in there; it was being used for a Euro repeat when we arrived, but as the night wore on it was shut off in favour of the music, which is entirely proper for any reputable establishment.\\\\n\\\\nDidn\\'t try any of the food, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked nice.  Prices for the beer and liquor are very modest for a watering hole that has a proper sense of design and great service about it.  Bottom line: certainly worth spending a few hours in here if you\\'re in the Plateau on a weekend night (or even a weeknight).  They\\'re opened until 3am each and every night, too -- c\\'est g\\\\u00e9nial!'},\n",

The guy ended up being another owner, her husband, and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review, but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now, he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again, texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area, you gotta try it.\"},\n",

You get a cool vibe inside the restaurant as well as the whole shopping area around it.  I really suggest getting a pizza and sitting on the patio outside in the courtyard.  While sitting outside in the courtyard it always gives me a feeling like I'm outside the Phoenix metro and in an area with culture.  I guess this is the real reason I come here, the pizza is great with the versatility, but only 4 stars in my book as regards with the taste and ingredients.\"},\n",

The basil rolls were fresh and the dipping sauce was the perfect sweetness with a tiny kick of spicy chile paste.

I love this restaurant, I think I would go on off hours or weeknights or expect a wait, the restaurant only sits about 75 people. It is priced reasonable at lunch, with a bottle of wine our bill for two was $60, half of that was the wine.  If you haven't eaten Thai food, I would recommend going with two or more people so you can order a lot of food and try a lot of different items.\\\\n\\\\nSo far, everything I have had has been off the charts fresh and scrumptious.

(My friend tried to help me, but only could partially).  Mike is very straight-forward and honest. Like all great mechanics, he gave me a very reasonable estimate for the repair needed to pass the emissions test (thermometer issue set off a code) and also alerted me to a slow oil leak. He assured me there wasn't any urgency, but that I should monitor it because eventually it could cause damage. I decided to do the repair for that at the same time. Total estimate was $400, but I was nicely surprised to total out at $350 because he was able to do the fixes in less time than he had thought he would. He also showed me the failed parts and explained what they did very succinctly. Good work. I could tell my air conditioning was working better within a few minutes of driving away. I will definitely go to Autostaat for future repairs (my car is 11 years old, so it's just a matter of time). Only tiny issue I had was communication. Everyone is very kind, but it is a small team so there was some back and forth getting the estimate and okaying the work, so be prepared to be a bit patient on that front; however the work they do and the price they do it at definitely makes them worth the small amount of extra communication time.\"},\n",

I had driven by earlier in the day and the parking lot was full, so it's a great place to watch a game with some buds and brew. I sat and talked with some of the regulars and it was a great conversation. It's the kind of place I wish didn't revolve around drinking, cuz I don't really like drinking all that much but I can see how somebody might get into that at the Deli Sports bar. I guess you could say the place can be addicting. From talking with the clientele it sounds like Friday and Saturday nights the place can be very busy, as well as the average Sunday and Monday night football season, (and I'm assuming any time a series of games are being played on the same day regardless of the sporting event.)\\\\n\\\\nThe juke box is awesome because it's actually hooked up to some proprietary Internet server system so you have tons of options for music (even classical, blues and Jazz). \\\\nOne saw one person get a little out of hand but he was promptly dealt with, but even with that I would still like to go there the again.

He is a super nice kid and speaks fluent English so the language barrier's gone. Yay Kevin! Kevin explained to me that they updated a few of their congee recipes to be less watery - they read their yelp reviews and take them pretty seriously. \\\\n\\\\nThey also added some buns to their menu. We tried the marinated beef one and the filling inside shocked me at how good it was. It tasted like it could be a dish on its own that people would order. One thing that deters me from buns is the soggy bottom that you sometimes get from steaming them and they don't have this at all! The dough is obviously handmade and tastes different from the super sweet buns you'd get in the frozen aisle. A pleasant change - it feels like you're eating real food. Even their homemade chili oil is amazing, I just want to smother everything in it. A little tip: their dumplings and congee are surprisingly good for a hangover.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I'm really glad there's a place for more wholesome options in the plaza. The walls are now adorned with plaques that tell you about the ingredients and preparation methods they use in their dishes, which reinforces that they strive for healthy but delicious food. I can't wait for school to start so I can go back again. And if you do go, say hi to Kevin :)\"},\n",

I had the French toast and my wife had a Mediterranean omelet and they were both tasty.  The French toast was some of the best French toast I have ever had, the butter was awesome.  It was a really good meal and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  So now that I have recommended Over/Easy based only on the food, I have to commend the manager for taking care of his customers.  I bought this living social coupon without reading the fine print, my bad, I'm sure we've all been there, and I wasn't supposed to be able to use it at the Gilbert Over/Easy, the coupon was for the Mesa Over/Easy.  I explained that I came all the way from Phoenix because I couldn't use my living social at the Phoenix Over/Easy and Jeff, the manager worked with me and applied a credit to my bill even though it was my mistake.  That's quality service that will keep me coming back.  I just had to let folks know, the food was good and that is the most important but the service was accommodating even though I was in the wrong and that's something every service oriented business should provide  Be good to people who keep the business going and they will come back.  Good food, great service.  I'll definitely be back.\"},\n",

We were promptly seated. Our server's name was Patty. She has worked at Compass for 29 years she said, and it showed in a very positive way. She was very sweet, and knew exactly how to do her job. I love a server who can converse and be down to earth while maintaining a certain level of professionalism. She was awesome. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered their very popular Eggplant Bisque Soup. The portion seemed a little small at first but even Patty mentioned that the soup is fairly rich. She was right!

These were yummy, but nothing mind blowing. It brought back memories of the cornbread my parents made when I was a kid. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the scallops which came with a corn risotto. The scallops were huge and very flavorful. The risotto was very good but I have to admit I wasn't a huge fan of the way it looked. That's me being picky though, it was still very good. \\\\n\\\\nFor desert we decided to have the fried zucchini bread and it was really good. \\\\n\\\\nThe prices are pretty hefty, the food was good, but really my server Patty and the amazing view of Phoenix while the sun went down is what pulled me in with this place. I would be sure to recommend people to sit with Patty as she really was a pleasure having as our server. I must say too that the girl that refreshed our drinks and water was very sweet too. She talked with us about the Suns game going on the evening we dined, as I saw traffic picking up downtown which doesn't usually happen on a Wednesday evening. \\\\n\\\\nOverall I say the food is a tad bit overpriced for the portions that are received, the decor could be changed up a little but it's a rotating restaurant after all. I enjoyed my meal, my friend enjoyed his meal, and I left happy. This would be a great place to take someone who hasn't seen Phoenix before as it makes you feel like you're in a big city and shows how far Phoenix goes with the views.

Needless to say, coal-fired pizza is now our new favorite.\\\\n\\\\nInitially we drove from the strip out to S. Rampart to get away from the congestion.  To our dismay, they said they had to clean the ovens (before the dinner rush hour) and we walked out totally disappointed.  Not 30 seconds later, waiter Moe, comes running out and says they can hold off with cleaning after our pizza.  Nowhere else would I have ever experienced someone who really understood and cared enough to do that.  Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and said \\\\\"oh well\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the roma tomato, fresh mozarella, and basil pizza.  Any other Margherita type pizzas are scarce with all their ingredients, but not this one.  I couldn\\'t believe how it was made with the eater in mind.  A bite of everything in every bite.  No skimping on their end.  We also ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer and it was outstanding, in flavor, presentation and portion size.  The moz they import from NY is so fresh and tender.  \\\\n\\\\nWe will definitely be back on our next visit to LV. \\\\n\\\\nNow we go back to VA where I have to drive 45 minutes for our second favorite pizza, wood-fired grilled. \\\\n\\\\nThanks Grimaldi\\'s on S Rampart and thanks Yelp reviewers of all the Grimaldi locations for leading us to a great find!\\\\n\\\\nNQ'},\n",

If it were not for Yelp recommendations, I probably would have never gone to this restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nLooking through the menu, most of the items are under $5.00... my college fund definitely goes a long way in this place!!  I decided to try out their hainanese chicken since that is what the restaurant is mainly known for.  Being it my first time having such dish, I thought it was actually quite delicious!  The chicken breast was really tender due to the method of how it was cooked; also, the condiments (hoisin and chili sauce) add a great taste to the dish.  Also tried their chicken curry with roti and a fried pork dish... but thought I would rather get those elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOverall experience? Big Wong Restaurant is a great place for lunch due to their affordable prices but definitely do not walk into this place with high expectations--YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR.  I actually like how the restaurant crews were yelling at each other half the time I was there since it makes the experience more authentic.  I will definitely be back!'},\n",

My wife\\'s \\\\\"cut\\\\\" was excellent and she healed perfectly.  I can not thank DOCTOR Schwartz enough.  If we could, we would definitely hug her.  Well deserved!!\\\\n\\\\nAs for the OB office, very clean, very courteous, and very professional.  We rarely waited more than 15 minutes.  Once we were in, the nurses were attentive, friendly, and helpful.\\\\n\\\\nThe only negative that I would say is that it was difficult to make appointments.  I guess they outsourced this and it is hard to get an exact date and time.\\\\n\\\\nOtherwise, everything was great.'},\n",

After basking in the golden glow of this exquisite beer-battered fish soaked in malt vinegar (because how else would you do it?!), I had some of the burger. Any burger with barbecue sauce and onion rings on it is sure to be good, but this one was phenomenal.

Too bad about the loooong wait for food.\\\\n\\\\nWe heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on New Years Day after going to the dog park downtown. \\\\n\\\\nWe placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes. Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one, or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary, and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system. \\\\n\\\\nThe self seating system can be a little chaotic, and you may have to wait around for people to leave. Many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours. The patio is dog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs, but be warned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.\\\\n\\\\nWe polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant. It was perfect. My bloody mary was awesome too, brimming with garden goodness. My only complaint is they are damn expensive. $9. Kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.\\\\n\\\\nThe 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait. The staff apologized profusely for the delay. I guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly. Luckily we had the day off and no where else to go, so we didn't mind too much.\\\\n\\\\nMy hubby and I both had the egg sandwich, but mine without bacon. It was scrumptious. Every ingredient was top notch. My only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole. The problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion. I DESPISE raw onion. If I would have know I would have skipped the guac. May sound finicky but I scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before I ate it. \\\\n\\\\nWe also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum.\\\\n\\\\nThe staff is helpful, warm, and a lot of fun. Even with the raw onion issue, the expensive bloody mary, and the long wait for food, the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to sample the rest of the menu.\"},\n",

Very rich so the mini size was perfect.

I wanted to compare this to the Garrett Popcorn mix from Chicago, and Garrett Popcorn wins this round for sure.\\\\n\\\\nHonestly - the 5 stars are for the dill pickle and jalapeno ranch (how many times have I typed out that flavor combination? getting redundant...) Based on the flavors I tried, I think they are on POINT with their savory flavors. The popped kernels aren't as big as Garrett Popcorn, but there is still great texture and I found very few unpopped kernels in the bags.  \\\\nPrices were also very reasonable! the amount you get for the money you pay is honestly a really really good value.

Also, the macarons from the dessert bar were too sweet and the texture wasn't right, either.

I was blown away by the athleticism and the creative storyline that provided a multitude of interpretations. I loved it and can't wait to see other cirque shows!\"},\n",

Both myself and my dining counterpart were shocked that they weren\\'t the \\\\\"out of the bag\\\\\" variety. These appeared to be hand breaded with a higher quality cheese than typically served. Marinara was standard, but the mozz sticks themselves were great. They also weren\\'t covered with the typical panko, moon dust, crappy breading like usual.\\\\n\\\\nWent with the buffalo chicken sandwich for my entree. Holy craaaaaap. Ditch the bun, eat a few of the house-made chips, and enjoy the chicken. Not only is this sucker lightly breaded and flavored well with the buffalo sauce, it\\'s straight up baptized in the sauce. Swimming, rather. I\\'m usually not for a pool of sauce, but this stuff was fantastic.

Not just Italian restaurants. I\\'m just as disappointed by AZ yelpers who think they know what authentic NY style is. So it was, with trepidation, that I heeded the advice of the reviews previous to this one, and booked a table for ten for a pre theater dinner. Well, you see the five stars. How good is RigaTony ?\\\\nLets start with service. We were pretty late for our 4:30 reservation after being stuck in traffic on the 10. They held the table, no problem, on a very busy evening. Even though we ordered our plates after 5 we got the early bird specials and the $3 glasses of wine. Again, not a problem. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very efficient. Sodas and waters were refilled without prompting. Sorry, I didn\\'t get her name. \\\\nThe food. Fresh Chapati comes to the table almost immediately . There are bottles of olive oil and small dishes of freshly chopped garlic too.  Make your own concoction. The early bird pasta dishes offer a good variety of  pasta and accompaniment, are plentiful, tasty and offered in fresh semolina or whole wheat and a great value at $6.95. Three of us ordered the veal parm which we all agreed was tender, tasty, and large enough to satisfy. The sauce was thick, tangy and garlicky, much like Carmines or many of the midtown (Manhattan) Italian eateries. Also ordered at our table was lasagna and a clam and mussel dish. All were very happy with their meal. The tab for it all was very reasonable.\\\\nThis is not a franchise restaurant. It is the real deal. RigaTony could make it in NY. The fact that it is in Tempe is, i think, fantastic.'},\n",

Maybe the buffet is cheaper, but I ordered from the menu so I could get the amazing onion bagee and a standard, but non-buffet entree, which was $17.

I\\'m like one of the citizens of the Capital in the Hunger Games. What have I become?!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI quickly parried that thought however; as much as I want to imagine myself in the vein of a half-starved (and ruggedly handsome) hero of District 12, sometimes...it\\'s nice to indulge. \\\\n\\\\nAnd at Bacchanal, indulge you will. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the get-go, you know you are going to try to cram as much food as humanly possible into your stomach to try and \\\\\"claw back\\'\\\\\" some of the steep entry price (~50$). As a long distance runner with seemingly hollow legs who burns thousands of calories a workout, I think I ended up okay at Bacchanal, maybe eating $30 or so dollars worth of food at its retail price. I can live with that. \\\\n\\\\nBeyond calculations of value (which are almost meaningless in Vegas, which seems to be fueled on the wispy fumes of luxury itself), the fare is par for the course. Everything I ate was of high quality and tasty. \\\\n\\\\nOne thing I didn\\'t like so much was the blaring Euro-hip music. I think they blast it so you\\'ll eat and leave more quickly, but...it was annoying not to be able to have conversations with the people I went with. \\\\n\\\\nSome things had an extra fine-tuned and endearing touch though, like the fish and chips in little metal frying crates or the Chinese dumplings in individual bamboo baskets (or maybe I\\'m easily impressed). \\\\n\\\\nEither way, those small details made the experience more than just a ridiculous gut-stuffing smorgasbord.'},\n",

The price is perhaps a tad high ($40 pp).  We had the kalbi beef (very good), Asian BBQ ribs (very good), beef ribs (very good), prime rib (good), scalloped potatoes (very good), mac n cheese bar (very good but too big a serving), crab legs (not so good as they were too small), duck confit ravioli (very good), fried calamari/oysters (too much breading), shrimp cocktail (pretty good), and short ribs on polenta (pretty good).  The desserts overall were very good.  The ambience is pretty upscale for a buffet.  Its hard to compare this buffet with Bacchanal as they were different kinds of buffets.

I even tried to re-create it at home.  It had watermelon, cantalope, honeydew and  cucumber along with a bunch of fresh herbs (including mint), goat cheese crumbles and slivered almonds in a light watermelon vinegrette.  I know, it sounds a little strange, but was light, summery and absolutely wonderful.  It's a shame it's only a special.....\\\\n\\\\nRegarding pizza: I have tried the Sausage pizza (excellent - with a great spicey sausage - very simple, but delicious), the Ricotta/Arugula pizza (I forget their name for it - but it is really good - I've ordered it twice).  They also have special pizzas and the last time I went there (for my own surprise birthday party) my best friend ordered their special Peach pizza.  I know it sounds weird but it was AMAZING!!!!!  I need to go back when they have it again - white cheese (no tomato sauce) with thin slices of fresh peaches and their wonderful charred crust - it was wonderful......\\\\n\\\\nAs for their sandwiches, I've tasted the chicken salad sandwich - really good if you love chicken salad.  With great fries, too!!\\\\n\\\\nHaven't tried any of their desserts but I heard the tiramisu is amazing.....\\\\n\\\\nOne negative thing I will say is the service needs improvement (hence the 4 out of 5 stars).  You have about a 50/50 chance of having a good service experience.  My brother and I went there and had a horrible server - my brother even wrote the manager to complain (which meant it was pretty bad).  The guy was good at the actual service part - refilling our drinks, etc., but his attitude SUCKED!!  It's like he was blaming us for the fact that he had to be at this crappy job with these crappy people, etc. (or at least that's what it felt like).  And another time, while the service itself was just okay, our girl didn't seem to know a whole lot about the menu, etc. \\\\n\\\\nBut, I've gone there twice and got excellent, friendly service.  So, hopefully they'll work on it.  The food will keep me going back..... \\\\n\\\\nLOVE IT!!!\"},\n",

It was crowded, but that did not affect the level of service we received or our comfort level.  The bread basket they bring is fantastic, as many note.  It may be the best gratis bread basket I've eaten at a steakhouse.  The cheesy muffins were out of this world good, I wish they would sell them so I can bake them at home.  Watch out you don't fill up on bread at this place.\\\\n\\\\nTo start, we had the garlic bread and calamari.  The garlic bread was stacked liked a small jenga tower, and sitting in a bed of cheese sauce.  It was crunchy and delicious when dipped in the sauce.  The calamari was likewise good, it had some peppers in it, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it Rhode Island style.  But, the peppers added some nice spice.  The breading was crisp and adhered to the calamari well.\\\\n\\\\nTo eat, we had the porterhouse for 4.  This was a good amount of steak for 4 people with sides, but if you are looking to eat a 25 ounce steak or larger on your own, it's not a good selection for you.  I preferred the NY strip side of the porterhouse, as I always do.  But, both sides were perfectly cooked to medium rare and had a nice char.\\\\n\\\\nFor sides, we had the lobster mac n cheese (which was a special I believe), the creamed spinach, and the famous tater tots with fat boy sauce.  The fat boy sauce is basically sour cream, large pieces of bacon, and shredded cheese mixed together.  The creamed spinach was fantastic, maybe the best version of this dish I've ever had.  It had a great crust on it and excellent flavor.  I had seconds, which makes the meal healthy because I had a vegetable, right?  \\\\n\\\\nThe mac and cheese was solid, but I've had better at many other steakhouses.  The tater tots were the real winner for me, they are large, but were perfectly fried and done in the middle.  You could taste that they are made of potato, which is not the case with most fast food tater tots.  The sauce was great on them as well.  I think returning to OH for a burger at lunch and enjoying these may be in my future.\\\\n\\\\nWe had baked Alaska for dessert.  It's always cool seeing it lit on fire, but this dish doesn't do it for me.  Not just at OH, but anywhere really.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the food was fantastic, and the service was great.  Wine, beer, and water glasses were never empty.  An excellent evening, and the price is in line with the high end steakhouses on the strip.

Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There\\'s an LGO.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s already an LGO \\\\\"intersection\\\\\" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it\\'s inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.\\\\n\\\\nI love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It\\'s worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You\\'ll get there in like 2 minutes!\\\\n\\\\nThe food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You\\'ll love that you did. :)'},\n",

       "               'review': 'This is the most self-inflicted adrenaline I\\'ve felt since bungee jumping.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, let me say that guns scare the crap out of me. I don\\'t even like being near a police officer with a holstered weapon... so walking into a shop full of assault rifles is like my adult version of a horror movie.  Still, I was with 5 other guys who were up for the adventure, so I got hold of my nerves and jumped into the breach.\\\\n\\\\nWe paid $110 each for some version of a party package that gave each of us the chance to shoot (a) a clip full on each of 4 different machine guns and (b) 2 rounds from a 50 caliber desert eagle handgun. For all those boys (and girls) out there who grew up with plastic guns or even shooting a rifle out somewhere at a range, it\\'s fair to say that this is in a whole different league.\\\\n\\\\nFor the machine guns, we chose the Uzi, Mac-10, M-5 and Grease Gun. The M-5 and Grease Gun were scarily easy and accurate to shoot, whereas the Uzi and Mac-10 felt a bit more wild but were fun just because they show up so often in the gangster movies.\\\\n\\\\nThe Desert Eagle handgun was intense. I\\'m not a big guy, so this thing felt like I could barely hang onto it. Still, we were able to shoot it with remarkable accuracy and the whole thing just served as a good reminder that it\\'s awfully easy to kill people with guns.\\\\n\\\\nLet me also give credit where it\\'s due to the guys who run this place. When I first heard about shooting machine guns in Vegas, I started to imagine a bunch of drunk guys all standing next to one another with loaded weapons and well, the potential for very bad things. That is not what really happens here. On the Saturday we were in, the Center was staffed by four very friendly but experienced ex-servicemen who make it clear that they have been around the block a few times. Out on the range, we were only with our 6 friends and we were accompanied by two staff members, one of whom is assigned to each weapon. They also stand right behind the the active weapon with a hand up, in a gesture that\\'s comforting to both the shooter and those around him.  \\\\n\\\\nI think it would be easy and probably natural for the staff here to look down on us yuppie types from NY and SF, but we never felt that. To me that in itself was impressive.\\\\n\\\\nAnd last but not least, Dave, the guy who I\\'d guess to be the owner, regaled us with his personal stories shooting each of these weapons in active duty (e.g., \\\\\"Oh, you think that 50 caliber is loud in there? One time I was being chased down an alleyway in Sierra Leone when...\\\\\")  \\\\n\\\\nIn any event, this is a fantastic option for those looking to branch beyond the casino while in Vegas. So head on in and hear the rest of Dave\\'s stories for yourself.'},\n",

The portion is enough for two and easily one of my favorite dishes, even though I haven't tried anything else.....it was just that good. The pork chop was tender and wasn't too seasoned so the pork flavor alone was enlightening. The waffle was a perfect sweetness and my eggs were as good as scrambled eggs can be. The portuguese donut it was paired with was cute, light and powdered with sugar. I didn't have much of it because I was already extremely full from the dish, which was bittersweet. I had a iced latte with vanilla and it was great, smooth and sweet. We also had the flight which will get you to that coffee high.

I can\\'t believe I never knew about it!\\\\n\\\\nAs Norm R. said, this is part of William Bartlett\\'s ranch dating back to 1886 with many original restored structures, some are brick and wood and one is stucco, and they all have that wonderful weathered old look to them that just makes you wonder \\\\\"if these walls could speak, what stories would they tell?\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nYou can peek inside the buildings and see the furniture, tools and stuff they used during the pioneer days and get a sense of what life was like in Old West Arizona. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also wander around the property and look at and even touch (but no climbing please!) lots of cool rusty old farm machinery, wagons and equipment, and wonder about what it was used for. \\\\n\\\\nI also saw: a blacksmith shop, a reproduction of a well building that would have been used in the 1920\\'s, something that looked like a locomotive engine, a dairy barn, a cornfield, a citrus orchard, grapevines, a rose garden, peacocks, rooster chasing a hen, the cutest white bunny I\\'ve ever seen in my life, and 7 beautiful princesses in ball gowns and tiaras posing for quincenera pictures.\\\\n\\\\nAll around the property are educational signs with info and photos about the original ranch and what life was like from the 1890\\'s thru the 1930\\'s (when the ranch was at the peak of production).\\\\n\\\\nI didn\\'t get a chance to take a tour, but I think that would be an excellent idea! The website says that tours are held Thursdays thru Saturdays, 10 AM - 2 PM, and Sundays 1 - 4 PM.\\\\n\\\\nI saw a sign that says you can even rent parts of the property for special events. (I gotta save up for a major shindig now!)\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s the perfect spot for an afternoon stroll when it isn\\'t unbearably hot, and there are tons of park benches where you can just rest and relax. If you have kids they will be super happy to see all the cool stuff and run around after the peacocks. Just don\\'t let them climb all over everything or lose them in the cornfield, and you\\'ll be good. \\\\n\\\\nSo, so glad this wonderful slice of Glendale\\'s history has been preserved.\\\\n\\\\nAnd admission is FREE!'},\n",

I found this Applebee\\'s not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \\\\\"550\\\\\" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \\\\n\\\\nSo while I\\'ve grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain.

After all the cocktails from the previous bars we visited, we were all quite famished! \\\\n\\\\nI ordered Steak nachos. It was pretty good. It had a side of guacamole, mild salsa & sour cream. The nachos were made up of the usual contents (cheese, pico de gallo, jalape\\\\u00f1os, etc). It's a pretty big portion for me so I couldn't finish it. Sometimes when I order the nachos some of the chips would come out burnt which is weird. \\\\n\\\\nMost of my friends got the chicken & waffles which is really popular here. I think they have one of the best waffles I ever had, but again I'm usually a couple cocktails in when I eat it. The chicken is pretty crispy. They also have like a hundred different hotsauces to choose from, all labeled with level of hotness. \\\\n\\\\nThe place is pretty spacious inside, they have an outdoor as well.

My dad had gotten a slice before our dinner and we knew that we would be in for more. After walking down a hall of records, I came across a white tiled pizza shop with no name.... yes, no name. After walking up to the counter I read the small menu on the wall, and all of a sudden, a worker with a heavy brooklyn accent asked what i wanted. I ordered a slice of sausage pizza, by looking at it i knew it would be good. I was rung up for a total of 5 dollars for a nice sized slice, after we just spent 225 for 4 at jaleo. This pizza was so simple but so tasty. Crispy thin foldable crust, hearty sauce, and authentic sausage. This is one of those stupid pizzas that everyone tells you about that taste so simple but so good. All together this place was great. After  i wolfed down the slice, i asked the lady at the register what the name is. She replied, \\\\\" we don\\'t have one, on yelp we\\'re known as secret pizza\\\\\". This made it that much better. Everytime im in vegas, i\\'ll know to go here when i don\\'t feel like burning money and i want a great pizza.'},\n",
